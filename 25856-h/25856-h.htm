<h2>Preface.</h2>


<p>This book is not intended for those who are acquainted with Anglo-Saxon
and Middle English; but for those who care for the thought, specially
the religious and devotional thought, of our forefathers. My one aim has
been to make a portion of that thought accurately intelligible to modern
readers, with the greatest possible saving of trouble to them. When I
could use the old word or phrase, with certainty of its being
understood, I have done so. When I could not, I have replaced it with
the best modern equivalent I could find or invent. In extenuation of the
occasional use of Rolle's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span> expression, "by their lone," I may urge its
expressiveness, the absence of an equivalent, and the fact that it may
still be heard in remote places. Where possible, I have retained the
archaic order of the original Text. Such irregular constructions, as
<i>e.g.</i>, the use of a singular pronoun in the first half of a sentence,
and of a plural in the second half, I have left unaltered; for the
meaning was perfectly clear. In short, I have endeavoured to make
Richard Rolle as he was as significant as possible to English men and
women of to-day as they are, when they are not professed students of
English language. In such an undertaking, it is obvious that I must have
presented endless vulnerable places to the learned. I can only repeat
that the book was never meant for them, but for those who will perhaps
forgive me if I describe them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span> as specialists in religious thought
rather than in English Language.</p>

<h2>Introduction.</h2>


<p>Richard Rolle of Hampole is the earliest in time of our famous English
Mystics. Born in or about 1300, he died in 1349, seven years after
Mother Julian of Norwich was born. Walter Hilton died in 1392.</p>

<p>An exhaustive account of Rolle's life is given in Vol. ii. of Professor
Horstman's Edition of his works, a book unfortunately out of print. The
main facts are recorded in a brief "Life" appended to Fr. R. Hugh
Benson's <i>A Book of the Love of</i> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>. Therefore, it will suffice to
say here that Richard Rolle seems to have been born at Thornton, near
Pickering, in Yorkshire, in or about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span> 1300; that, finding the atmosphere
of Oxford University uncongenial, he left it, and for some four years
was supported, as a hermit, by the Dalton Family. By the end of that
time, through prayer, contemplation and self-denial, he had attained the
three stages of mystical life which he describes as <i>calor</i>, <i>dulcor</i>,
<i>canor</i>; (heat, sweetness, melody.) The next period of his life was less
easy. Having left the protection of the Daltons, and being without those
means of subsistence which are within the reach of priest or monk, this
hermit depended for his daily bread on other men's kindness. Not that he
was a useless person: apart from the utility of a life of Prayer, he
could point to counsel and exhortation given; to the existence of
converts consequent upon his ministrations. To add to his difficulties,
he preached a doctrine of high pure selflessness with which, the average
man, in all times,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span> seems to have no abundant sympathy: and to crown all
he was endowed by nature with a sensitive temper. His remarkable gifts
forced him into public notice; his cast of thought and his temperament
were not calculated to win him ease or popularity. Professor Horstman is
peculiarly severe to those among his enemies and detractors "who called
themselves followers and disciples of Christ." The insertion here of
this painful passage would introduce a jarring note; moreover, the raked
embers of past controversy seldom tend to the spiritual improvement of
the present. An interesting judgment by Professor Horstman on Rolle's
place in mysticism is too long for quotation; but the following sentence
may be taken as the pith of it:&mdash;"His position as a mystic was mainly
the result of the development of scholasticism. The exuberant luxuriant
growth of the brain in the system of Scotus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span> called forth the reaction
of the heart, and this reaction is embodied in Richard Rolle, who as
exclusively represents the side of feeling as Scotus that of reason and
logical consequence; either lacking the corrective of the other
element."</p>

<p>It is consoling to know that Rolle's last years were passed in peace, in
a cell, near a monastery of Cistercian nuns at Hampole, where the nuns
supported him, while he acted as their spiritual adviser.</p>

<p>In the book mentioned above, Fr. Hugh Benson has translated some of
Richard Rolle's Poems, and certain devotional Meditations. In this
Volume, four of his Prose Treatises have been selected from the rest of
his works, in the belief that they may supplement those parts of Rolle's
writings with which, those who are interested in these phases of
thought, are already familiar.</p>

<p>The first, <i>The Form of Perfect Living</i>, is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> a Rule of Life which he
wrote for a nun of Anderby, Margaret Kirkby, of whom Professor Horstman
writes: "She seems to have been his good angel, and perhaps helped to
smooth down his ruffled spirits. This friendship was lasting&mdash;it lasted
to their lives' ends."</p>

<p>This treatise was written of course to meet the requirements of the
"religious" life. It has seemed expedient, because supplementary, then,
to put next to it his work on <i>Our Daily Life</i>, which was meant for
those who are "in the world"; and which may give pause to some who might
otherwise criticise the first hastily, perhaps condemning it as
unpractical, or even objectionable in a world where, after all, men must
eat and drink and live, and where some, therefore must provide the
necessary means. Most intensely practical is this second treatise, and
perhaps nowhere more so than when it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span> meets the needs of those who are
inclined to split straws over the definition of the word "good." What
<i>is</i> a good action?&mdash;such people love to inquire, and like "jesting
Pilate," sometimes do not "stay for an answer." Richard Rolle has no
manner of doubt about his reply. An action must be good in itself,
<i>i.e.</i>, so he would tell us, pleasing to God in its own nature. But the
matter by no means ends there for him. This good action must be
performed,&mdash;and it is this which is, now palpably, now subtly,
hard&mdash;<i>entirely</i> for the sake of goodness, without the slightest taint
of self-seeking, of vanity, of secret satisfaction that we are not as
other men are, not even as this Pharisee or this Publican.</p>

<p>Such a motive, inspiring each person's whole work, would surely go far
to remove what is known as the Social Problem. It would make many a
house the dwelling of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> peace, many a business-place an abode of honour.
If we could get back to Richard Rolle's simplicity and to his unmovable
faith, then, his goal, even the acquisition of perfect love, might seem
to all of us less distressingly remote.</p>

<p>The present rendering has been taken from the longer and more elaborate
of the two MSS. containing the Treatise. The shorter form of his work
<i>On Grace</i> and <i>the Epistle</i> have been added in the hope that they may
meet the need of all, contemplative or active as they may chance to be.</p>

<p>There is, among his voluminous writings, a curious and interesting
<i>Revelation concerning Purgatory</i>, purporting to be a woman's dream
about one, Margaret, a soul in Purgatory. Amidst much natural horror,
not however exceeding that described by Dante, there are many quaint
side-lights thrown upon our forefathers' ways of thought;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span> as <i>e.g.</i>,
when Margaret's soul is weighed in one scale, against the fiend, "and a
great long worm with him," in the other; the worm of conscience, in
fact. But the work has not been included in this volume, lest it should
prove wholly unprofitable to a generation which if it be not readily
disturbed by sin, is easily and quickly shocked by crude suggestions
concerning its possible consequences and reward. They will find enough,
perhaps, in the treatise <i>on Daily Work</i>.</p>

<p>If any one should think that there, and in one portion of the treatise
<i>on Grace</i>, Rolle has dwelt harshly on considerations of fear, rather
than on those of love, he must not make the mistake of concluding that
these admonitions represent the whole of Catholic teaching on the point.
Men's temperaments differ, and teachers, meeting these various tempers,
differ in their modes of helping them. Side by side with Richard Rolle
may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span> be put the words of S. Francis Xavier, in what is perhaps the most
beautiful of Christian hymns:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My <span class="smcap">God</span>, I love Thee; not because<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I hope for heaven thereby,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor yet because who love Thee not<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are lost eternally.<br /></span></div>
<div class="stanza"><span class="i2">. . . . . .</span></div>
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Not for the hope of gaining aught,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not seeking a reward;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But as Thyself hast loved me,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O ever-loving Lord!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Moreover, no reader of the Epistle <i>on Charity</i> can entertain any doubt
as to whether our English Mystic understood the mystery of limitless
love.</p>

<p>It is no doubt, easy to complain, as we read certain passages, that
Richard Rolle's recommendations are neither new nor original: but if
instead of dismissing them as familiar, we tried to put them into
practice, we should perhaps have less leisure for idle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span> criticism of
others, and ourselves be less evil and tiresome people.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the accusation may be brought that he proposes an
impossibly high aim. No doubt, in such a pitch of devotion as is
suggested, <i>e.g.</i>, in ch. viii. of <i>The Form of Perfect Living</i>, some
may think they find extravagance: but no doubt it was this same spirit
which inspired SS. Peter and Paul, and the other Apostles; which built
up the Early Church; which made Saints, Martyrs and Confessors; which
suggested such apparently forlorn hopes as that of S. Augustine of
Canterbury, when, to bring them the Gospel of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, he bearded
the rough Men of Kent, and (according to Robert of Brunne) reaped, as
his immediate reward, a string of fishtails hung on his habit, though
later, the conversion of these sturdy pagans. It was doubtless, too, the
spirit which inspired the best men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span> and women in the English Church,
before they began to confuse the spheres of Faith and Reason, and to
disregard S. Hilary's warning about the difficulty of expressing in
human language that which is truly "incomprehensible,"&mdash;incomprehensible
in the old sense, as in the Athanasian Symbol, "Immensus Pater, immensus
Filius, immensus Spiritus sanctus"; till, indeed, men forgot, for all
practical purposes that infinity transcends the grasp of finite minds
(in fact, as well as in placidly accepted and then immediately neglected
theory); and can be apprehended only, and that imperfectly, by the best
aspirations of a heart, set of fixed purpose on that high goal.</p>

<p>To the modern Englishman, immersed in business anxieties, imperial
interests and domestic cares, the invitation repeated so often by
Richard Rolle, to love <span class="smcap">God</span> supremely, may seem incalculably unreal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
remote, even though he might hesitate to confess it baldly. But what if
the Englishman who so loved <span class="smcap">God</span>, were also the greater Englishman? And
what answer does history return to that plain question?</p>

<p>"Richard Rolle," Professor Horstman does not hesitate to write "was one
of the most remarkable men of his time, yea, of history. It is a strange
and not very creditable fact that one of the greatest of Englishmen has
hitherto been doomed to oblivion. In other cases, the human beast first
crucifies, and then glorifies or deifies the nobler minds, who swayed by
the Spirit, do not live as others live, in quest of higher ideals by
which to benefit the race; he, one of the noblest champions of humanity,
a hero, a saint, a martyr in this cause has never had his resurrection
yet&mdash;a forgotten brave. And yet, he has rendered greater service to his
country, and to the world at large, than all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span> the great names of his
time. He rediscovered Love, the principle of Christ. He reinstalled
feeling, the spring of life which had been obliterated in the reign of
scholasticism. He re-opened the inner eye of man, teaching contemplation
in solitude, an unworldly life in abnegation, in chastity, in
charity.... He broke the hard crust that had gathered round the heart of
Christianity, by formalism and exteriority, and restored the free flow
of spiritual life."</p>

<p>This passage, to those who feel that there has been no age since the
Birth of Christ when the great principles of religious life have been
wholly lost, and who remember that Richard Rolle lived in the age of
Dante, may seem overstated. But it shews sufficiently at least, and for
that reason is quoted here, what a great Englishman he was, and what a
debt his unaware countrymen owe him; a debt which they could pay in the
way most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span> grateful to him, by listening to his words.</p>

<p>It may be remarked, by the way, that Rolle is not inclined to substitute
individualism for the authority of the Church; a change which has been
brought against some mystics. There is immense emphasis laid, all
through his writings, on the importance of conduct. The penetrating
analysis, in ch. vi, of <i>The Form of Perfect Living</i>, of the possible
sins humanity can commit on its journey through the wilderness of this
world, hardly leaves a corner of the heart unlighted; lets not one
possible shift, twist or excuse of the human conscience go free. But it
all has the Church as its immediate background; the Mystical <i>Body</i>, not
the individual soul in isolation, is everywhere taken for granted. Man
lives not to himself nor dies to himself, even though he be Richard
Rolle the hermit, or Margaret Kirkby the recluse, that is the plain
teaching of these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[xxv]</a></span> plain-speaking pages. And all through them too is a
tough common sense, and an unusually alert power of observation; and
there is perhaps an element of that business capacity, which some of the
Saints and Mystics have shewn, in his inclusion among "sins of deed" of
"beginning a thing that is above our might"; for in that there is not
only pride, but a kind of stupid incapacity surely.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that Rolle's tendency to repetition may tire any
one who reads him "straight on," as the phrase is. But it is doubtful
whether that be the best means of approach. If he be read in bits, he
will prove far more effective: and his ability to hit the right nail on
the head, and to hit it wonderfully hard, may occasionally bring his
words home to our immediate circumstances with an appositeness that may
be more than a coincidence.</p>

<p>In the past, the learned and ignorant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[xxvi]</a></span> alike have been guilty of the
operation which may be described as cutting man up into parts: <i>i.e.</i>,
they have been inclined to treat him now as if he were all intellect,
then as if he were all feeling; while to the will a kind of intermediate
part has generally been allotted, as if it were the handmaid instead of
the master of the other two. And there is still, in some quarters, a
tendency to relegate the will and the feelings to an inferior plane, if
indeed they be allowed any place at all. In other quarters, the
onslaught is made on intellect. Men are bidden to be humble, to become
as little children; as if there were any humility in thinking
incorrectly or not at all; as if the odd, though suppressed, assumption
that children have no intellects had any ground in fact. It is surely a
true apostrophe&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<span class="smcap">God</span>! Thou art mind! Unto the master-mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Mind should be precious."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The Angelic Doctor himself paid a tribute to the importance and special
difficulties of intellect, and also to the necessity of uniting it with
will:&mdash;"the martyrs had greater merit in faith, not receding from the
faith for persecutions; and likewise men of learning have greater merit
of faith, not<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> receding from the faith for the reasons of philosophers
or heretics alleged against it." Richard Rolle, following on the same
lines as S. Thomas Aquinas, has nothing of this spirit of division: the
whole being is what he would fain see offered to <span class="smcap">God</span>, whether it be so
by Margaret Kirkby, or by those who are "in the world," for whom <i>Our
Daily Work</i> was written. In the image of <span class="smcap">God</span> was man made, and therefore
<span class="smcap">God</span> suffices for all the needs of man's nature: that, at least seems to
be the underlying idea when Rolle writes:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">God</span> is light and burning.
Light<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span> clarifies our reason, burning kindles our will." May we not say
here too?&mdash;"What <span class="smcap">God</span> has joined together, that let not man put asunder."</p>

<p>Above all things, Rolle aims at a perfect balance, culminating in a
harmony ruled by one power, and that the greatest in the world, Love.
Real love, he asks; not the degraded things to which men give that great
name, as to every passing gust of feeling, to every unworthy untamed
emotion: but the divine quality, when to the "lastingness," which he
requires, is also joined that which is the inner essence of Love, viz.,
sacrifice. "Love is a life," he writes, "joining together the loving and
the loved." And then he remembers the other great gift to men,
intellectual sincerity, which has inspired all "who follow Truth along
her star-paved way"; and he gives to that its place and due: "Truth may
be without love:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span> but it cannot help without it." Even then, the whole
tale is not complete; the way of the Saints is not "Primrosed and hung
with shade." Love, with Rolle, is no easy sentimentality: it involves
definite sacrifice in more directions than one; it demands thought,
perseverance, supernatural strength, natural strenuousness; it is not a
selfish enjoyment of a circumambient atmosphere wrapping humanity,
without responsibility or effort of its own: "Love is a <i>Life</i>."</p>

<p>"Love," he writes, "is a perfection of learning; virtue of prophecy;
fruit of truth; help of sacraments; establishing of wit and knowledge;
riches of pure men: life of dying men. So, how good love is. If we
suffer to be slain; if we give all that we have (down) to a beggar's
staff: if we know as much as men may know on earth, all this is naught
but ordained sorrow and torment." Then, with that sound sense, which is
not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span> the least element in the sum of his attractiveness, he utters a
subtle warning against that all too common sin, judging one another: "If
thou wilt ask how good is he or she, ask how much he or she loves: and
that no man can tell. For I hold it folly to judge a man's heart, that
none knows save <span class="smcap">God</span>."</p>

<p>After this it cannot be necessary to say that Rolle is a true mystic.
"Many," so he tells us in this same chapter x., "Many speak and do good,
and love not <span class="smcap">God</span>." But that will not suffice his exacting demands. A man
is not "good" until his interior disposition be all filled and taken up
with pure love of <span class="smcap">God</span>. And as he analyses the Christian Character, there
is a pleasant blunt directness about this holy man:&mdash;"he that says he
loves <span class="smcap">God</span> and will not do what is in him to shew love, tell him that he
lies."</p>

<p>It is possible that the alarming list of sins of the heart, in chapter
vi., may give the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span> heedless and even the heedful matter for grave
thought, as each one finds himself ejaculating with spontaneous
fear&mdash;"Who can tell how oft he offendeth? Cleanse thou me from my secret
faults."</p>

<p>Surely no one need fear that the outcome of a study of Richard Rolle
will be effeminacy. Not that that indeed is the special temptation of
the English: a chill commonplace acquiescence in a convenient, if
baseless, hope that somehow "things will come all right," is far more
likely to lead them astray than any "burning yearning to <span class="smcap">God</span> with a
wonderful delight and certainty." Is not George Herbert's cry apposite
still?</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O England, full of sin, but most of sloth!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor can any one argue fairly that this absorption of the mystic is just
selfish idleness. It is, so it seems, as we read Rolle's injunctions, of
the nature of hard exacting toil. No doubt, there must be those who do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span>
the material work of the world; who gain, among other things, those
"goods" which go to support the Mystics. But there will be no lack of
such workers, through the inroads of religion; the broad ways of daily
life are in no danger of contracting suddenly in to the path to the
strait gate. Moreover, natural life itself is a poor thing unsupported
by an unseen stream of spiritual refection. Here, as elsewhere in the
ordered economy of things, two forms of life are found to be
complementary. It is true, as Dr. Bigg once wrote:&mdash;"If Society is to be
permeated by religion, there must be reservoirs of religion like those
great storage places up among the hills which feed the pipes by which
water is carried to every home in the city. We shall need a special
class of students of <span class="smcap">God</span>, men and women whose primary and absorbing
interest it is to work out the spiritual life in all its purity and
integrity."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is indeed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span> the idlest of criticism that condemns such
people as slothful or selfish.</p>

<p>There is one charm in our own Mystics which we may miss in S. John of
the Cross or S. Teresa for example; viz., that with all their zeal,
there is also an amazing reality and simplicity down at the bottom of
it, which may seem to us not present in the rhapsodies of more southern
lovers; though in all probability such seeming is purely racial.
Nevertheless, we may be thankful if we find the antidote to our national
prosaic ways in the sane zeal of others of our nation.</p>

<p>Lastly, as men read, they may be overcome perhaps by despair. This pure
untainted selflessness of which Richard Rolle writes almost glibly, how
can it be possible here and now? How can men and women, fixed in and
condemned to the dusty ways of common life, unable as they are to leave
the world even if they would, how can they so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span> as dream of such
unattainable heights? Is there no help for them in the often quoted
lines of a later English Mystic?&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<p>In every sinful man and woman that is bound in deadly sin, are three
wretchednesses, the which bring them to the death of hell. The first is:
<i>Default of ghostly strength</i>. That they are so weak within their heart,
that they can neither stand against the temptations of the fiend, nor
can they lift their will to yearn for the love of <span class="smcap">God</span> and follow
thereto. The second is: <i>Use of fleshly desires</i>:&mdash;for they have no will
nor might to stand, they fall into lusts and likings of this world; and
because they think them sweet, they dwell in them still, many till
their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> lives' end, and so they come to the third wretchedness. The third
is, <i>Exchanging a lasting good for a passing delight</i>: as who say they
give endless joy for a little joy of this life. If they will turn them
and rise to penance, <span class="smcap">God</span> will ordain their dwelling with angels and with
holy men. But because they choose the vile sin of this world, and have
more delight in the filth of their flesh than in the fairness of heaven,
they lose both the world and heaven. For he that hath not <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ
loses all that he hath, and all that he is, and all that he might get.
For he is not worthy of life, nor to be fed with swine's-meat. All
creatures shall be stirred in His vengeance in the day of Doom. These
wretchednesses that I have told you of are not only in worldly men and
women, who use gluttony, lust, and other open sins: but they are also in
others who seem in penance and godly life. For the devil that is enemy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to all mankind, when he sees a man or a woman among a thousand, turn
wholly to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and forsake all the vanities and riches that men who love
this world covet, and seek lasting joy, a thousand wiles he has in what
manner he may destroy them. And when he can not bring them into such
sins which might make all men wonder at them who knew them, he beguiles
many so privily that they cannot oftentimes feel the trap that has taken
them.</p>

<p>Some he takes with <i>error</i> that he puts them in. Some with <i>singular
wit</i>, when he makes them suppose that the thing that they say or do is
best; and therefore they will have no counsel of another who is better
and abler than they; and this is a foul stinking pride; for such man
would set his wit before all other. Some, the devil deceives through
<i>Vain-glory</i>, that is idle joy; when any have pride and delight in
themselves, of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> penance that they suffer, of good deeds that they
do, of any virtue that they have; are glad when men praise them, sorry
when men blame them, have envy of them who are spoken better of than
they. They consider themselves so glorious, and so far surpassing the
life that other men lead, that they think that none should reprehend
them in anything that they do or say; and despise sinful men, and others
who will not do as they bid them. How mayst thou find a sinfuller wretch
than such a one? And so much the worse is he because he knows not that
he is evil, and is considered and honoured of men as wise and holy. Some
are deceived by <i>over-great lust and liking in meat and drink</i>, when
they pass measure and come into excess, and have delight therein; and
they know not that they sin, and therefore they amend them not, and so
they destroy virtues of soul. Some are destroyed with <i>over-great
abstinence</i> of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> meat and drink and sleep. That is often temptation of
the devil, for to make them fall in the midst of their work, so that
they bring it to no ending as they should have done, had they known
reason and had discretion; and so they lose their merit for their
frowardness. This snare our enemy lays to take us with when we begin to
hate wickedness, and turn us to <span class="smcap">God</span>. Then many begin a thing that they
can never more bring to an end: then they suppose that they can do
whatsoever their heart is set on. But oftentimes they fall or ever they
come midway; and that thing which they supposed was for them is
hindering to them. For we have a long way to heaven, and as many good
deeds as we do, as many prayers as we make, and as many good thoughts as
we think in truth and hope and charity, so many paces go we heavenwards.
Then, if we make us so weak and so feeble that we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span> can neither work nor
pray as we should do, nor think, are we not greatly to blame that fail
when we had most need to be stalwart? And well I wot that it is not
<span class="smcap">God's</span> will that we so do. For the prophet says: "Lord, I shall keep my
strength to Thee," so that he might sustain <span class="smcap">God's</span> service till his
death-day, and not in a little and a short time waste it, and then lie
wailing and groaning by the wall. And it is much more peril than men
suppose. For S. Jerome says that he makes an offering of robbery who
outrageously torments his body by over-little meat or sleep. And S.
Bernard says: "Fasting and waking hinder not spiritual goods, but help,
if they be done with <i>discretion</i>; without that, they are vices."
Wherefore, it is not good to torture ourselves so much, and afterwards
to have displeasure at our deed. There have been many, and are who
suppose it is naught all that they do unless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> they be in so great
abstinence and fasting that all men speak of them who know them. But
oftentimes it befalls that the more outward joy or wondering they have
(on account) of the praising of men, the less joy they have within of
the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>. By my judgment, they should please <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ much
more if they accepted for His sake&mdash;in thanking and praising Him, to
sustain their body in His service and to withhold themselves from great
speech of men&mdash;whatsoever <span class="smcap">God</span> sent them in time and place, and gave
themselves since entirely to the love and the praising of that Lord
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ: Who will stalwartly be loved, and lastingly be served, so
that their holiness were more seen in <span class="smcap">God's</span> eye than in man's. For all
the better thou art, and the less speech thou hast of men, the more is
thy joy before <span class="smcap">God</span>. Ah! how great it is to be worthy of love, and to be
not loved. And what wretchedness it is,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span> to have the name and the habit
of holiness, and be not so; but to cover pride, ire or envy under the
clothes of Christ's childhood. A foul thing it is to have liking and
delight in the words of men who can no more deem what we are in our soul
than they wot what we think. For ofttimes they say that he or she is in
the higher degree that is in the lower; and whom they say is in the
lower, is in the higher. Therefore I hold it to be but madness to be
gladder or sorrier whether they say good or ill. If we be trying to hide
us from speech and praise of this world, <span class="smcap">God</span> will shew to us His praise,
and our joy. For that is His joy when we are strength-full to stand
against the privy and open temptation of the devil, and to seek nothing
but the honour and praise of Him, and that we might entirely praise Him.
And that ought to be our desire, our prayer and our intent, night and
day, that the fire of His love kindle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> our hearts, and the sweetness of
His grace be our comfort and our solace in weal and woe. Thou hast now
heard a part how the fiend deceives, with his subtle craft, unknowing
men and women. And if thou wilt do by good counsel and follow holy
teaching, as I hope that thou wilt, thou shall destroy his traps, and
burn in love's fire all the bands that he would bind thee with; and all
his malice shall turn thee to joy, and him to more sorrow. <span class="smcap">God</span> suffers
him to tempt good men for their profit, that they may be the higher
crowned, when they, through His help, have overcome so cruel an enemy,
that oftentimes, both in body and soul, confounds many men.</p>

<p>In three manners, the devil has power to be in a man. In one manner,
hurting the good they have by <i>nature</i>, as in dumb men, and in others,
staining their thoughts. In another manner, snatching away the good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
that they have of <i>grace</i>: and so he is in sinful men whom he has
deceived through delight of the world and of their flesh, and leads them
with him to hell. In the third manner, he torments a man's body, as we
read that he has done (to) Job. But wit thee well, if he beguile thee
not within, thou needst not dread what he may do to thee without, for he
may do no more than <span class="smcap">God</span> gives him leave to do.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>Because thou hast forsaken the solace and the joy of this world, and
taken thee to solitary life, for <span class="smcap">God's</span> sake to suffer tribulation and
anguish here, and afterwards to come to that bliss which never more
ceases, I trow truly that the comfort of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, and the sweetness
of His love, with the fire of the Holy Ghost, that purges all sin, shall
be in thee, and with thee, leading thee and teaching thee how thou shalt
think, how thou shalt pray, what thou shalt work, so that in a few years
thou shalt have more delight to be by thy lone, and to speak to thy Love
and thy Spouse <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, Who is high in heaven, than if thou wert
lady here of a thousand worlds. Men suppose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> that we are in torture and
in penance great; but we have more joy and more very delight in a day
than they have in the world all their life. They see our body: but they
see not our heart where our solace is. If they saw that, many of them
would forsake all that they have, for to follow us. Therefore, be
comforted and stalwart, and dread no annoy or anguish: but fasten all
thine intent in <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, that thy life be good and convenient; and look
that there be nothing in thee that should be displeasing to Him that
thou dost not soon amend it. The state which thou art in, which is
solitude, is most able of all other to revelation of the Holy Ghost. For
when S. John was in the Isle of Patmos, then <span class="smcap">God</span> shewed him His secrets.
The goodness of <span class="smcap">God</span> it is that He comforts them wonderfully that have no
comfort of the world, if they give their heart entirely to Him, and
covet not nor seek but Him: then He gives<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> Himself to them in sweetness
and delight, in burning of love, and in joy and melody and dwells aye
with them, in their soul, so that the comfort of Him departs never from
them. And if they any time begin to err, through ignorance or frailty;
soon He shews them the right way; and all that they have need of, He
teaches them. No man to such revelation and grace on the first day may
come; but through long travel and carefulness to love <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, as
thou shall here-afterward. Nevertheless, then he suffers them to be
tempted in sore manners, both waking and sleeping. For aye the more
temptations and the grievouser they stand against and overcome, the more
they shall joy in His love when they are passed. Waking, they are
sometimes tempted with foul thoughts, vile lusts, wicked delights, with
pride, ire, envy, despair, presumption and other many. But their remedy
shall be:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span> Prayer: Weeping: Fasting: Waking. These things, if they be
done with discretion, they put away sin and filth from the soul, and
make it clean to receive the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, Who may not be loved,
but in cleanness. Also, sometimes the fiend tempts men and women, who
are solitary, by their love in a quaint manner and a subtle: he
transfigures himself in the likeness of an angel of light, and appears
to them, and says he is one of <span class="smcap">God's</span> angels come to comfort them, and so
he deceives fools. But they that are wise and will not quickly trust to
all spirits, but ask counsel of knowing men, he can not beguile them.
Also, I find written of a recluse, that was a good woman, to whom the
ill-angel oft-times appeared in the form of a good angel, and said that
he was come to bring her to heaven. Wherefore, she was right glad and
joyful. But nevertheless, she told it to her Shrift-father, and he, as a
wise<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span> man and wary, gave her this counsel. When he comes, he said, bid
him that he shew thee our Lady, S. Mary. When he has done so, say <i>Ave
Maria</i>. She did so. The fiend said: "Thou hast no need to see her; my
presence suffices to thee." And she said by all means she would see her.
He saw that it behoved him either to do her will, or she would despise
him: so quickly, he brought forth the fairest woman that might be as to
her sight, and shewed to her. And she set her on her knees and said,
<i>Ave Maria</i>. And so quickly all vanished away, and for shame never after
came he to her. This I say not, because I hope he shall have leave to
tempt thee in this manner, but because I will that thou beware, if any
such temptation befall thee sleeping or waking, that thou trust not over
quickly till thou knowest the truth. More privily he transfigures
himself into an angel of light&mdash;that commonly all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span> men are tempted
with&mdash;when he hides ill under the likeness of good. And that is in two
manners. One is, when he eggs us on to over-great ease and rest of body,
and softness to our flesh, for need to sustain our nature. For such
thoughts he puts in us: that unless we eat well, and drink well, and
sleep well, and lie soft and sit warm, we can not serve <span class="smcap">God</span>, nor last in
the labour that we have begun. But he thinks to bring us to over-great
pleasure. Another is, when under the likeness of ghostly good, he
entices us to sharp and over-great penance, for to destroy ourselves;
and says thus: "Thou wot'st well that he who suffers most penance for
<span class="smcap">God's</span> love, he shall have most meed. Therefore eat little, and feeble
meat; and drink less, the thinnest drink is good enough to thee. Reck
not of sleep: wear the hair-shirt and the habergeon. All thing that is
affliction for thy flesh, do it; so that there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> may be none that can
pass thee in penance. He that speaks thee thus, is about to slay thee
with over-great abstinence; as he that said the other to slay thee with
over-little. Therefore, if we will be rightly disposed, it behoves us to
set ourselves in a good mean, and that we may destroy our vices and hold
our flesh under, and nevertheless that it should be stalwart in the
service of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ. Also, our enemy will not suffer us to be in
rest when we sleep, but then he is about to beguile us in many manners.
Sometimes, with ugly images, for to make us afraid and to make us
hateful of our state: sometimes with fair images, fair sights and that
seem comfortable; for to make us glad in vain, and make us think we are
better than we are. Sometimes, tells us we are holy and good, for to
bring us into pride; [sometimes says we are wicked and sinful for to
make us fall into despair.] But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> He Who is Ordainer of all things,
suffers not that our sleep be without reward to us, if we dress our life
to His Will. And wit thou well, thou sinnest not sleeping, if waking
thou beest evermore without excess of meat and drink, and without
ill-thoughts. But many a one the devil has deceived, through dreams,
when he has made them set their heart on them. For he has shewn them
some truth, but afterwards beguiled them with one that was false.
Therefore says the wise man that many cares follow dreams; and they fell
that hoped in them. Wherefore that thou beest not beguiled with them, I
will that thou wit that <i>there are six manners of dreams</i>. Two are, that
no man, holy or other, may escape: they are, if their stomach be
over-empty or over-full; then many vanities, in sore manners, befall
them sleeping. The third is of illusions of our enemy. The fourth is, of
thought before and of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span> illusions following. And the fifth through the
revelation of the Holy Ghost, that is done in many a manner. The sixth
is, of thoughts before that are due to Christ or Holy Church, revelation
coming after. In thus many manners, the image of dreams touches men when
they sleep. But so much the less shall we give faith to any dream,
because we can not wit which is truth, which is false; which is of our
enemy, which is of the Holy Ghost. For where many dreams are, there are
many vanities. And many they may make to err, for they set up unwise
men, and so deceive them.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>I know that thy life is given to the service of <span class="smcap">God</span>. Then is it shame to
thee, unless thou beest as good, or better, within thy soul, as thou art
seeming in the sight of men. Turn therefore thy thoughts perfectly to
<span class="smcap">God</span>, as it seems that thou hast done thy body. For I will not that thou
shouldest ween that all are holy that have the habit of holiness, and
are not occupied with the world. Nor that all are ill who discourse of
earthly business. But they only are holy, what state or degree they be
in, the which despise all earthly things, that is to say, love it not;
and burn in the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ; and all their desires are set to
the joy of heaven, and hate all sin, and cease<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> not from good works, and
feel a sweetness in their heart of the love without end: and
nevertheless, they think themselves vilest of all, and hold themselves
wretchedest, least and lowest. This is holy men's life; follow it and be
holy. And if thou wilt be in the Apostles' reward, think not what thou
forsookest, but what thou despisest. For they who follow <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ in
willing poverty, and in meekness, and in charity, and in patience,
forsake as much as they can covet who follow Him not. And consider with
how great and how good will thou presentest thy vows before Him: for on
that He has set His eyes, and if thou with great desire offerest thy
prayers, with great fervour desirest to see Him, and seekest no earthly
comfort, but the savour of Heaven, and in contemplation thereof hast thy
delight. Wonderfully <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> works in His lovers, those whom he reaves
from the pleasure of flesh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> and blood through tender love. He makes them
to will no earthly thing, and makes them rise to the solace of Him, and
to forget vanities and fleshly loves of the world, and to dread no
sorrow that may fall: to diminish over-great bodily ease: to suffer for
His love, seems to them joy; and to be solitary they have great comfort:
so that they be not hindered of that devotion. Now mayst thou see that
many are worse than they seem, and many are better than they seem, and
namely among those that have the habit of holiness. Therefore force
thyself, in all that thou mayest, that thou mayest be no worse than thou
seemest. And if thou wilt do as I teach thee in this short form of
living, I hope, through the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>, that if men hold thee to be
good, thou shalt be well better.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>At the beginning then, bow thee entirely to thy Lord <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ. That
turning to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> is naught else but turning from all the covetousness
and the liking and the occupations and business of worldly things and of
fleshly lust and of vain love: so that thy thought, that was ever
downward, burrowing in the earth, whilst thou wert in the world, now
should be aye upward like fire; seeking the highest place in heaven,
right to thy Spouse, where He sits in His bliss. To Him thou art turned,
when His grace illumines thine heart; and forsakes all vices, and
conforms it to virtues and good manners, and to all manner of compliance
and debonairness. And that thou mayst last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> and grow in the goodness
that thou hast begun without slowness, and sorriness, and irking of thy
life; four things shalt thou have in thy thought, till thou beest in
perfect love. For when thou art come thereto, thy joy and desire will
aye be burning in Christ. One is: <i>the measure of thy life here, that it
is so short that scarcely is it anything</i>. For we live but in a
point&mdash;that is the least thing that may be. And soothly, our life is
less than a point, if we liken it to the life that lasts aye. Another
is: <i>uncertainty of our ending</i>. For we wot never when we shall die, nor
where we shall die, nor how we shall die, nor whither we shall go when
we are dead; and that <span class="smcap">God</span> wills that this be uncertain to us, for He
wills that we be aye ready to die. The third is: <i>that we shall answer
before the righteous Judge</i>, for all the time that we have been here,
how we have lived, what our occupation has been and why, and what good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
we might have done when we have been idle. Therefore said the prophet:
"He has called thee times again," that is every day He has lent us here
for to spend in good use, and in penance, and in <span class="smcap">God's</span> service. If we
waste it in earthly love and in vanities, full grievously must we be
condemned and punished; for that is one of the greatest sorrows that may
be: unless we try manfully in the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and do good to all that
we may, while our short time lasts. And every time that we think not on
God we may count it as the thing that we have lost. The fourth is: <i>that
we think how great the joy is that they have who last in <span class="smcap">God's</span> love to
their ending</i>. For they shall be brethren and fellows with angels and
holy men, loving and thanking, praising and seeing the King of Joy in
the beauty and in the shining of His majesty. The which sight shall be
reward and food, and all delights that any creature may think,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span> and more
than any can tell, to all His lovers, without end. It is much easier to
come to that bliss than to describe it. <i>Also think what pain and what
sorrow and tormenting they shall have</i> who love not <span class="smcap">God</span> above all things
that one sees in this world, but defile their body in the pleasures and
lusts of this life, in pride and greed and other sins; they shall burn
in the fire of hell with the devil whom they served, as long as <span class="smcap">God</span> is
in heaven with His servants, that is evermore.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>I will that thou beest aye climbing to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>-ward, and increasing thy
love and thy service to Him; not as fools do; they begin in the highest
degree and come down to the lowest. I say not that if thou hast begun
unreasonable abstinence that thou hold it; but for many who were burning
at the beginning and able to (capable of) the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ,
through over-great penance they have hindered themselves, and made
themselves so feeble that they cannot love <span class="smcap">God</span> as they should. In the
which love that thou mayest wax aye more and more is my coveting and my
admonition. I consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> thee never of the less merit if thou beest not
in so great abstinence; but if thou set all thy thought how thou mayest
love thy Spouse <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ more than thou hast done, then dare I say
that thy reward is waxing not waning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>Wherefore, that thou may'st be rightly disposed both for thy soul and
thy body, thou shalt understand four things. The first thing is: <i>what
thing defiles a man</i>. The second thing: <i>what makes him clean</i>. The
third: <i>what holds him in cleanness</i>. The fourth: <i>what thing draws him
for to ordain his will entirely at <span class="smcap">God's</span> will</i>. For the first, wit thou
that we sin in three things that make us foul: that is with <i>heart</i> and
<i>mouth</i> and <i>deed</i>. The sins of the heart are these: Ill-thought: ill
delight: assent to sin: desire of ill; wicked will: ill suspicion:
undevotion: if thou lettest thine heart any time be idle, without
occupation of the love, of the praising of <span class="smcap">God</span>: ill dread:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span> ill love:
error: fleshly affection to thy friends or to other that thou lovest:
joy in any man's ill-faring, whether they be enemy or none: contempt of
poor or sinful men: to honour rich men for their riches: unsuitable joy
in any world's vanity: sorrow of the world: impatience: perplexity, that
is doubt what to do and what not, for every man ought to be secure
(about) what he shall do and what he shall leave: obstinacy in ill:
annoyance (at having) to do good: sorrow that he did no more ill, or
that he did not have that pleasure or that will of his flesh which he
might have done: unstableness of thought: pain at penance: hypocrisy:
love to please men: dread to displease them: shame of good deed: joy of
ill deed: singular wit: desire for honour or dignity, or to be holden
better than another, or richer, or fairer, or more to be dreaded: vain
glory of any good of nature, of happening, or of grace:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> shame of poor
friends: pride of rich or of gentle kin, for all we alike are free
before <span class="smcap">God's</span> face, unless our deeds make any better or worse than
another, in spite of good counsel and of good teaching. <i>The sins of the
mouth</i> are these: to swear oftentimes: forswearing: slander of Christ or
of any of His Saints; to name His name without reverence; gainsaying and
strife against truthfulness; murmuring against <span class="smcap">God</span> for any anguish or
trouble or tribulation that may befall on earth: to say <span class="smcap">God's</span> Service
undevoutly and without reverence: backbiting; flattering: lying:
abusing: cursing: defaming: quarrelling: threatening: sowing of discord:
treason: false-witness: ill counsel: scorn: unbuxomness in speech: to
turn good deeds to ill: to make them be holden ill who do them: (we
ought to wrap up our neighbours' deeds in the best not the worst);
exciting any man to ire: reprehending <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>in another what one does one's
self: vain speech: much speech: foul speech: to speak idle words: or to
speak words not needful: praising: polishing of words: defending sin:
shouting with laughter: making grimaces at any man: to sing secular
songs and to love them: to praise ill-deeds: to sing more for the glory
of men than of <span class="smcap">God</span>. <i>The sins of deed are these</i>: gluttony: lechery:
drunkenness: simony: witch-craft: breaking of the holy-days: sacrilege:
to receive <span class="smcap">God's</span> Body in deadly sin: breaking of vows: apostacy:
dissipation in <span class="smcap">God's</span> service: to set example of ill deeds: to hurt any
man in his body, or in his goods, or in his fame: theft: rapine: usury:
deceit: selling of righteousness: to hearken ill: to give to harlots: to
withhold necessaries from the body, or to give it to excess: to begin a
thing that is above our might: custom to sin: falling often into sin:
feigning of more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span> good than we have: for to seem holier, more learned
and wiser than we are: to hold office that we do not suffice to: or to
hold one that cannot be held without sin: to lead dances: to bring up
new fashions: to be rebellious against one's Sovereign: to insult those
who are less: to sin in sight, in hearing, in smelling, in touching, in
handling, in swallowing: in means: in signs: in beggings: writings. To
receive the circumstances, that is to say time, place, manner, number,
person, dwelling, knowledge, age, that makes thee sin more or less. To
desire a sin or to be tempted: to constrain one to sin. Other many sins
there are <i>of omission</i>, that is, of leaving good undone: when men leave
the good they should do. Not thinking about <span class="smcap">God</span>, nor dreading, nor
praising Him, nor thanking Him for His gifts: to do not all that one
does for love of <span class="smcap">God</span>: to sorrow not for one's sins as one should do: not
to dispose one's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span> self to receive grace. And if one have taken grace,
not to use it as one ought; not to keep it: to turn not to the
inspiration of <span class="smcap">God</span>: to conform not one's will to <span class="smcap">God's</span> will: to give not
attention to one's prayers, but mutter on and never reck save that they
be said; to do negligently what one was bound by vow to do, or by
command, or else enjoined in penance: to draw out at length what should
be done soon: having no joy at one's neighbour's profit as at one's own;
not sorrowing at his ill-faring: standing not against temptations:
forgiving not those who have done one harm: keeping not faith with one's
neighbour as one would that he did to one's self: and yielding not a
good deed for another if one can. Amending not those sins before one's
eyes: not appeasing strifes: not teaching them that are unlearned: not
comforting them that are in sorrow, or in sickness, or in poverty, or
in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> penance, or in prison. These sins, and many others make men foul.
<i>The things that cleanse us of that filth</i>, are three, against these
three manners of sins. The first is: <i>sorrow of heart</i> against the sin
of thought: and that it behoves (thee to) be so perfect that thou beest
in full will never to sin more. And that thou mayest have sorrow for all
thy sins. And that all joy and solace, except of <span class="smcap">God</span> and in <span class="smcap">God</span>, be put
out of thine heart. The second is: <i>shrift of mouth</i>; against the sin of
mouth. And that shall be <i>hasty</i>, without delaying. <i>Naked</i>, without
excusing. Whole, without parting. Also (not) for to tell one sin to one
priest and another to another. Say all that thou wottest to one, or else
thy shrift is not worth. The Third is, <i>Satisfaction</i>; that has three
parts, Fasting, Prayer, and Alms-Deed. Not only to give poor men meat
and drink: but to forgive them that do thee wrong and pray for them:
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span> inform them who are at the point to perish what they shall do. For
the third thing, thou shalt wit that cleanness behoves to be kept in
heart, in mouth and in work. <i>Cleanness of heart</i>, three things keep:
one is, watchful thought and stable about <span class="smcap">God</span>. Another is, care to keep
thy five wits, so that all the wicked stirrings of them be closed out of
the flesh. The third, honest and profitable occupation. Also, <i>cleanness
of mouth</i>, three things keep: one is that thou should'st bethink thee
before thou speakest. Another is that thou beest not of great but of
little speech; and specially ever till thine heart be established in the
love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ: so that men think thou ever lookest on Him,
whether thou speakest or not. But such a grace may'st thou not have on
the first day: but with long travel and great care to love Him from
habit, so that the eye of thine heart be aye upward, shalt thou come
thereto.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> The third, that thou for nothing, not even for meekness, shalt
lie to any man. For every lie is sin and ill: and not <span class="smcap">God's</span> will. Thou
needest not tell all the truth always, unless thou willest. But hate all
lies. If thou sayest a thing of thyself that seems to thy praise, but
thou sayst it to the praise of <span class="smcap">God</span> and help of another, thou dost not
unwisely for thou speakest truth. But if thou will have aught private,
tell it to none but such a one that thou beest secure that it should not
be shewed (disclosed) but only to the praise of <span class="smcap">God</span>, of whom is all
goodness, and who makes some better than others, and gives them special
grace, not only for themselves, but also for them that will do well
after their example. <i>Cleanness of work</i>, three things keep. One is: <i>a
careful thought of death</i>: for the wise man says; "Bethink thee of thy
last ending, and thou shalt not sin." The second: <i>flee from ill
fellowship</i>, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span> gives more example to love the world than <span class="smcap">God</span>, earth
than heaven, filth of body than cleanness of soul. The third is:
<i>temperance and discretion in meat and drink</i>: that it be neither to
excess, nor beneath suitable sustenance for thy body. For both come to
one end: excess and over-great fasting: for neither is <span class="smcap">God's</span> will&mdash;and
that many will not suppose, for anything one may say. If you take
sustenance of such good as <span class="smcap">God</span> sends for the time and the day, whatever
it be, I take out no manner of meat that Christian men use; with measure
and discretion, thou dost well; for so did Christ and His Apostles. If
you leave many meats that men have, not despising the meat that <span class="smcap">God</span> has
made for man's help, but because thou thinkest thou hast no need
thereof, thou dost well: if thou seest that thou art stalwart to serve
<span class="smcap">God</span>, and that it breaks not thy stomach. For if thou hast broken it with
over-great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> abstinence, appetite for meat is reft from thee: and often
shalt thou be in tremblings, as if thou wert ready to give up the ghost.
And wit thou well, thou didst sin that deed. And thou may'st not wit
soon whether thine abstinence be against thee, or with thee. For the
time thou art going, I counsel thee that thou should'st eat better and
more, as it comes, that thou beest not beguiled. And afterward, when
thou hast proved many things, and overcome many temptations, and knowest
better thyself and <span class="smcap">God</span> than thou didst, then if thou seest that it be to
be done, thou mayst take to greater abstinence. And meanwhile thou mayst
do privy penance which all men need not know. Righteousness is not all
in fasting or in eating. But thou art righteous, if contempt and praise,
poverty and riches, hunger and need or delights and dainties be all
alike to thee. If thou takest these with love of <span class="smcap">God</span>, I hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> thee
blessed and high before <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>. Men who come to thee, they love thee
because they see thy great abstinence, and because they see thee
enclosed: but I may not love thee so lightly for anything I see thee do
without, but if thy will be conformed entirely to <span class="smcap">God's</span> will. And set
not by their praise and blame, and never give thou heed if they speak
less good of thee than they did; but that thou shouldest be more burning
in <span class="smcap">God's</span> love than thou wert. For one thing I warn thee: I hope that <span class="smcap">God</span>
has no perfect servant in earth without enemies of some men&mdash;For only
wretchedness has no enemy. <i>For to draw us that we conform our will to
<span class="smcap">God's</span> will</i>: are three things. One is, example of holy men and women,
who were intent, night and day, to serve <span class="smcap">God</span>, and dread Him and love
Him. If we follow them on earth, we must be with them in heaven. Another
is the goodness of our Lord, which despises none,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span> but gladly receives
all that come to His mercy: and He is homelier to them than brother or
sister, or any friend that they most love, or most trust in. The third
is the wonderful joy of the kingdom of heaven, which is more than tongue
may tell, or heart may think, or eye may see, or ear may hear. It is so
great that, as in hell nothing might live for great pain but that the
might of <span class="smcap">God</span> suffers them not to die; so the joy in the sight of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>
in His <span class="smcap">God</span>-head is so great that they must die of joy, if it were not
for His goodness, who wills that His lovers should be living aye in
bliss: also His righteousness wills that all who loved Him not, be aye
living in fire, which is horrible to any man that thinks: look then what
it is to feel. But they who will not think of it and dread it now, they
shall suffer it evermore. Now hast thou heard how thou mayst dispose thy
life, and rule it to <span class="smcap">God's</span> will. But I wot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span> well that thou desirest to
hear some special point of the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, and of
contemplative life, which thou hast taken to thee in all men's sight.
(According) As I have grace and knowledge, I will teach thee.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>Amore langueo. These two words are written in the Book of Love, that is
called the Song of Love, or the Song of Songs. For he that loves
greatly, lists often to sing of his love, for joy that he or she has
when they think on that they love, specially if their love be true and
loving. And this is the English of these two words: "I languish for
love." Separate men on earth have separate gifts and graces of <span class="smcap">God</span>, but
the special gift of those who lead the solitary life, is for to love
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ. Thou sayest to me, 'All men love Him who keep His
commandments.' That is Truth. But all men who keep His bidding keep not
also His Counsel. And all that do His Counsel are not all fulfilled by
the sweetness of His love, nor feel the fire of burning love of heart.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Therefore, the diversity of love makes the diversity of holiness and of
need. In heaven, the angels who are most burning in love, are nearest to
<span class="smcap">God</span>. Also, men and women that have most of <span class="smcap">God's</span> love, whether they do
penance or none; they shall be in the highest degree in heaven: they who
love Him less, in the lower order. If thou lovest Him much, great joy
and sweetness and burning thou feelest in His love, that is thy comfort
and strength night and day. If thy love be not burning in Him: little is
thy delight. For Him may no man feel in joy and sweetness, unless they
be clean and filled with His love; and thereto shalt thou come with
great travail in prayer and thanking, having such meditations as are all
on the love and the praising of <span class="smcap">God</span>. And when thou art at thy meal, ever
love <span class="smcap">God</span> in thy thought, at each moment, and say thus in thine heart:
<i>Loved be Thou, King: and thanked be Thou,</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> <i>King, and blessed be Thou,
King, <span class="smcap">Jesu</span> all my joying, of all Thy good gifts: Who for me spilt Thy
blood, and died on the rood. Do Thou give me grace to sing the song of
Thy praise.</i> And think it not only whiles thou eatest, but both before
and after, and ever when thou prayest or speakest. Or if thou hast other
thoughts, that thou hast more sweetness in and devotion than in those
that I teach thee, thou may'st think them. For I hope that <span class="smcap">God</span> will put
such thoughts in thine heart, as He is pleased with, and as thou art
ordained for. When thou prayest, look not how much thou sayest, but how
well: that the love of thine heart be aye upward, and thy thought on
what thou sayst as much as thou canst. If thou beest in prayers and
meditations all the day, I wot well that thou must wax greatly in the
love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, and feel much of delight, and within short time.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>Three degrees of love I shall tell thee, for I would that thou mightest
win to the highest. The first degree is called <i>Insuperable</i>. The second
<i>Inseparable</i>. The third is, <i>Singular</i>. Thy love is Insuperable, when
nothing that is contrary to <span class="smcap">God's</span> love overcomes it: but it is stalwart
against all temptations; and stable, whether thou beest in ease or in
anguish, or in health or in sickness: so that men think that thou
wouldest not, even to have all the world without end, make <span class="smcap">God</span> angry at
any time: and thou wert liefer, if so it should be, to suffer all the
pain and woe that might come to any creature, before thou wouldst do the
thing that should displease Him. In this manner shall thy love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span> be
Insuperable that nothing can bring it down, but it may aye spring on
high. Blessed is he or she who is in this degree: but yet are they
blesseder who might hold to this degree and turn to the other, that is
to <i>Inseparable</i>. <i>Inseparable</i> is thy love, when all thine heart, and
thy thought, and thy might is so wholly, so entirely and so perfectly
fastened, set and established in <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, that thy thought comes
never from Him, never departs from Him, sleeping excepted: and as soon
as thou awakest, thine heart is on Him, saying <i>Ave Maria</i>, or <i>Gloria
Tibi, Domine</i>, or <i>Pater Noster</i>, or <i>Miserere mei, <span class="smcap">Deus</span></i>, if thou hast
been tempted in thy sleep; or thinking on His love and His praise as
thou didst waking. When thou canst at no time forget Him, waking or
sleeping, whatso thou dost or sayst, then is thy love <i>Inseparable</i>.
Full great grace have they that be in this degree of love. And methinks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that thou, who hast nothing else to do but for to love <span class="smcap">God</span>, mayst come
thereunto if any may get it.</p>

<p>The third degree is highest and most wondrous to win. That is called
<i>Singular</i>, for it has no peer. <i>Singular</i> love is when all comfort and
solace is closed out of thine heart, but of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ alone. Other
joy it delights not in. For the sweetness of Him in this degree is so
comforting, and lasting in His love, so burning and gladdening, that he
or she who is in this degree can as well feel the fire of love burning
in their soul, as thou canst feel thy finger burn if thou puttest it in
the fire. But that fire, if it be hot, is so delectable and so
wonderful, that I cannot tell it. Then, thy soul is loving <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>,
thinking of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, desiring <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>; in covetousness of Him breathing; to
Him singing: of Him burning; in Him resting. Then the song of praise and
of love has come. Then, thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span> thought turns into song and into melody.
Then it behoves thee to sing the psalms which before thou said'st. Then
must thou be long over a few psalms. Then, thou wilt think death sweeter
than honey, for then thou art full of sighs to see Him whom thou lovest.
[Then mayst thou boldly say "I languish for love."] Then mayst thou say
"I sleep, and my heart wakes."</p>

<p>In the first degree, men may say "I languish for love," or "I long in
love." And in the second degree also: for languishing is when men fail
for sickness, and they who are in these two degrees fail from all the
covetousness of this world, and from lust and liking of sinful life, and
set their will and their heart to the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>&mdash;therefore they may
say "I languish for love," and much more that are in the second degree
than in the first. But the soul that is in the third degree is all
burning fire, and like the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span> nightingale that loves song and melody, and
fails for great love: so that the soul is only comforted in praising and
loving <span class="smcap">God</span>; and till Death come, is singing ghostly to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and in
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, and <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>; not crying bodily with the mouth&mdash;of that manner of
singing I speak not, for both good and evil have that song. And this
manner of song have none unless they be in this third degree of love: to
the which degree it is impossible to come, but in a great multitude of
love. Therefore, if thou wilt wot what kind of joy that song has, I tell
thee, that no man wots, save he or she who feels it, who has it, and who
loves <span class="smcap">God</span> singing therewith. One thing tell I thee, it is of heaven, and
<span class="smcap">God</span> gives it to whom He will, but not without great grace coming before.
Who has it, he thinks all the song and all the minstrelsy of earth
naught but sorrow and woe (compared) thereto. In sovereign rest shall
they be who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span> get it. Wanderers and brawlers, and keepers of comers and
goers early and late night and day, or any who are seized with any sin
witfully and willingly, or who have delight in any earthly thing, they
are also farther therefrom than heaven is from earth. In the first
degree, are many: in the second degree are full few; but in the third
degree are scarcely any: for aye the greater is the perfection the fewer
followers it has. In the first degree, men are likened to the stars, in
the second to the moon, in the third to the sun. Therefore says S. Paul:
"Others of the sun, others of the moon, others of the stars," so it is
of the lovers of <span class="smcap">God</span>. In this third degree, if thou mayst win thereto,
thou shalt know of more joy than I have told thee yet. And among other
affections and songs, thou mayst, in thy longing, sing this in thine
heart to thy Lord <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, when thou dost covet His coming and thy going:
"<i>When</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span> <i>wilt Thou come to comfort me: and bring me out of care, and give
me Thee, Whom I may see, having evermore? My heart when shall it burst?
for love then languished I no more. For love my thought has fast, and I
am fain to fare away. I stand still mourning for the loveliest of lore;
...</i><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> <i>is love-longing; it draws me to my day; The brand of sweet
burning for it holds me aye: From place and from playing: till I may get
sight of my sweet One, Who never wends away. In wealth be our waking,
without hurt or night. My love is everlasting, and longs unto that
sight.</i>"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>If thou wilt be well with <span class="smcap">God</span>, and have grace to rule thy life, and come
to the joy of love: this name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, fasten it so fast in thy heart that
it come never out of thy thought. And when thou speakest to Him, and
through custom sayst, <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, it shall be in thine ear, joy; in thy
mouth, honey; and in thine heart, melody: for men shall think joy to
hear that name be named, sweetness to speak it, mirth and song to think
it. If thou thinkest (on) <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> continually, and holdest it firmly, it
purges thy sin, and kindles thine heart; it clarifies thy soul, it
removes anger and does away slowness. It wounds in love and fulfils
charity. It chases the devil, and puts out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span> dread. It opens heaven, and
makes a contemplative man. Have <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> in mind, for that puts all vices
and phantoms out from the lover. And often hail Mary, both day and
night. Much love and joy shalt thou feel, if thou wilt do after this
teaching. Thou need'st not covet greatly many books: hold love in thine
heart and work, and thou hast all that we can say or write: for fulness
of the law is charity: on that hangs everything.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>But now, thou mayst ask me and say, "Thou speakest so much of love; tell
me&mdash;<i>What is love, and where is love. And how I shall love <span class="smcap">God</span> verily.
And how that I may know that I love Him. And in what state I may most
love Him.</i>" These are hard questions to teach, to a feeble man and
fleshly as I am. But nevertheless therefore, I shall not delay that I
shall not shew my wit, and as I think it may be. For I hope in the help
of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, who is the well of love and peace and sweetness. Thy first
asking is: <i>What is love?</i> And I answer: Love is a burning yearning
after <span class="smcap">God</span>, with a wonderful delight and certainty. <span class="smcap">God</span> is light and
burning. Light clarifies our reason; burning <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>kindles our will, that we
desire naught but Him. Love is a life, joining together the loving and
the loved. For meekness makes us sweet to <span class="smcap">God</span>. Purity joins us to <span class="smcap">God</span>.
Love makes us one with <span class="smcap">God</span>. Love is the beauty of all virtues. Love is
the thing through which <span class="smcap">God</span> loves us, and we Him, and each one of us
loves others. Love is the desire of the heart, aye thinking on that it
loves; and when it has that it loves, then it joys and nothing can make
it sorry. (Love is yearning between two, with lastingness of thoughts.)
Love is a stirring of the soul for to love <span class="smcap">God</span> for Himself, and all
other things for <span class="smcap">God</span>; the which love, when it is ordained in <span class="smcap">God</span>, it
does away all inordinate love in anything that is not good. But all
deadly sin is inordinate love for a thing that is naught: then love puts
out all deadly sin. Love is a virtue which is the rightest affection of
man's soul. Truth may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> be without love: but it cannot help without it.
Love is a perfection of learning, virtue of prophecy, fruit of truth,
help of sacraments, establishing of wit and knowledge; riches of pure
men; life of dying men. So, how good love is. If we suffer to be slain;
if we give all that we have, (down) to a beggar's staff; if we know as
much as men may know on earth, all this is naught but ordained sorrow
and torment. If thou wilt ask how good is he or she, ask how much he or
she loves; and that no man can tell. For I hold it folly to judge a
man's heart; that none knows save <span class="smcap">God</span>. Love is a righteous turning from
all earthly things, and is joined to <span class="smcap">God</span>, without departing, and kindled
with the fire of the Holy Ghost: far from defiling, far from corruption,
bound to no vice of this life. High above all fleshly lusts, aye ready
and greedy for the contemplation of <span class="smcap">God</span>. In all things not overcome.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>The sum of all good affections. Health of good manners; goal of the
commandments of <span class="smcap">God</span>; death of sins; life of virtues. Virtue whilst
fighting lasts, crown of over-comers. Mirth<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> to holy thoughts. Without
that, no man may please <span class="smcap">God</span>; with that, no man sins. For if we love <span class="smcap">God</span>
in all our heart, there is nothing in us through which we serve sin.
Very love cleanses the soul, and delivers it from the pain of hell, and
from the foul service of sin, and from the ugly fellowship of the
devils; and (out) of the fiend's son, makes <span class="smcap">God's</span> son, and partner of
the heritage of heaven. We shall force ourselves to clothe us in love,
as iron or coal does in the fire, as the air does in the sun, as the
wool does in the dye. The coal so clothes itself in fire that it is
fire. The air so clothes itself in the sun that it is light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span> And the
wool so substantially takes the dye that it is like it. In this manner
shall a true lover of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ do: his heart shall so burn in love,
that it shall be turned into the fire of love, and be as it were all
fire; and he shall so shine in virtues that no part of him shall be
murky in vices.</p>

<p>The second asking is: <i>Where is love?</i> And the answer: love is in thine
heart, and in the will of man; not in his hand, nor in his mouth: that
is to say, not in his work, but in his soul, "For many speak good and do
good, and love not <span class="smcap">God</span>: as hypocrites, who suffer great penance, and
seem holy in man's sight. But because they seek praise and honour of
men, and favour, they have lost their meed: and in the sight of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
they are devil's sons, and ravishing wolves. But if a man give
alms-deed, and take him to poverty and do penance, it is a sign that he
loves <span class="smcap">God</span>: but therefore loves he Him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> not, save when he forsakes the
world only for <span class="smcap">God's</span> love, and sets all his thought on <span class="smcap">God</span>, and loves
all men as himself: and all the good deeds that he may do, he does them
with intent to please <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, and to come to the rest of heaven.
Then he loves <span class="smcap">God</span>: and that love is in his soul, and so his deeds shew
without. If thou speakest good and doest good, men suppose that thou
lovest good: therefore look well that thy thought be in God, or else
thou deceivest thyself, and deceivest men. Nothing that I do without
(outside) proves that I love <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>

<p>For a wicked man might do as much penance in body, as much waking and
fasting as I do. How may I then ween that I love, or hold myself better,
on account of that which any man may do? Certainly, my heart, whether it
loves my <span class="smcap">God</span> or not, wots no one but <span class="smcap">God</span>, for nought that they may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span> see
me do. Wherefore, love is in will verily, not in work, but in a sign of
love. For he that says he loves <span class="smcap">God</span>, and will not do what is in him to
shew love, tell him that he lies. Love will not be idle, it is working
some good evermore. If it cease working, wit thou that it cools and goes
away.</p>

<p>The third asking is: <i>How shall I verily love <span class="smcap">God</span></i>? I answer; Very love
is to love Him with all thy might, stalwartly: in all thine heart,
wisely: in all thy soul, devoutly and sweetly. Stalwartly can no man
love Him save he be stalwart. He is stalwart, who is meek; for all
ghostly strength comes of meekness;&mdash;on whom rests the Holy Ghost? in a
meek soul. Meekness governs us and keeps us in all our temptations, so
that they overcome us not. But the devil deceives many that are meek,
through tribulations, and reproofs, and back-bitings*. But if thou beest
wroth for any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span> anguish of this world, or for any word that men say of
thee, or for aught that men say to thee, thou art not meek, nor mayst
thou love <span class="smcap">God</span> stalwartly. For love is stalwart as death, which slays
every living thing on earth, and hard as hell that spares not them that
are dead. And he who loves <span class="smcap">God</span> perfectly grieves Him not, whatever shame
or anguish he may suffer; but he has delight and covets that he might be
worthy for to suffer torment and pain for Christ's love: and he has joy
that men reprove him and speak ill of him. Like a dead man, what so men
do or say, he answers not. Right-so, whoso loves <span class="smcap">God</span> perfectly, they are
not stirred for any word that man may say. For he or she cannot love,
that cannot suffer pain or anger for their friend's love. For whoso
loves, they have no pain. Proud men or women love not stalwartly, for
they are so weak, and they fall at every stirring of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span> the wind that is
temptation. They seek a higher place than Christ; for they will have
their will done, whether it be with right or with wrong: and Christ
wills that nothing but well be done, and without harm to other men. But
who is verily meek, they will not have their will in this world, but
that they may have it in the other fully. In nothing may men sooner
overcome the devil than in Meekness, which he much hates. For he may
wake, and fast and suffer pain more than any other creature may: but
meekness and love may he not have. Also, it behoves thee to love <span class="smcap">God</span>
wisely, and that thou canst not do save thou beest wise. Thou art wise,
when thou art poor without desire of this world, and despisest thyself
for love of Christ: and expendest all thy wit and all thy might in His
service. For some who seem wise are most fools, for all their wisdom
they spill in covetousness and care about the world. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span> thou sawest a
man have precious stones wherewith he might buy a kingdom, if he gave
them for an apple, as a child will do, rightly mightest thou say that he
was not wise but a great fool. Just so, if we will, we have precious
stones: Poverty and penance and ghostly travail, with the which we may
buy the kingdom of heaven. For, if thou lovest poverty and despisest
riches and delights of this world, and holdest thyself vile and poor,
and thinkest thou hast naught of thyself save sin: for this poverty,
thou shalt have riches without end. And if thou hast <i>sorrow for thy
sins</i>, and because thou art so long in exile out of thy country, and
forsakest the solace of this life: thou shalt have for this sorrow the
joy of heaven. And if thou beest <i>in travail</i>, and punishest thy body
reasonably and wisely, by wakings, fastings, and in prayers and
meditations, and sufferest heat and cold, hunger and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span> thirst, privation
and anguish for the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ; for this travail thou shalt
come to rest that lasts aye, and sit on a settle of joy with angels. But
some there are who love not wisely, like children who love an apple,
more than a castle. So do many; they give the joy of heaven for a little
delight of their flesh, that is not worth a plum. Now canst thou see,
that whoso will love wisely, it behoves him to love lasting things,
lastingly; and passing things, passingly; so that his heart be settled
and fastened on nothing but <span class="smcap">God</span>. And if thou wilt love <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> verily,
thou shalt not only love Him stalwartly and wisely, but also <i>devoutly
and sweetly</i>. Sweet love is when thy body is chaste and thy thought
clean. Devout love is; when thou offerest thy prayers and thy thoughts
to <span class="smcap">God</span> with ghostly joy, and burning heart in the heat of the Holy
Ghost; so that men think that thy soul is as it were drunken for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
delight and solace of the sweetness of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>; and thy heart conceivest
so much of <span class="smcap">God's</span> help that men think thou mayst never be departed from
Him: and then thou comest into such rest and peace in soul, and quiet,
without thoughts of vanity, (or) of vices, as if thou wert in silence
and sleep, and set in Noe's ship, so that nothing may hinder thee from
devotion and sweet love. For thou hast gotten His love: all thy life,
until death come, in joy and comfort: and thou art verily Christ's
lover: and he rests in peace whose place is made in peace.</p>

<p>The fourth asking was: <i>how thou mightest know that thou wast in love
and charity</i>. I answer: that no man wots on earth that they are in
charity; save it be through any privilege or special grace that <span class="smcap">God</span> has
given to any man or woman: that all others may not take example by. Holy
men and women trow that they have truth and hope and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span> charity: and in
that do as well as they may, and hope certainly that they shall be safe;
they wot it not so quickly; for if they wish, their merit were the less.
And Solomon says it is so with righteous men and wise men, and that
their works are in <span class="smcap">God's</span> hand. And nevertheless, a man wots not whether
he be worthy hatred or love; but all is reserved uncertain for another
world. Nevertheless, if any had grace that he might win to the third
degree of love, which is called <i>Singular</i>, he should know that he was
in love. But in such manner were the knowing, that he might never bear
himself the higher, nor be in less care to love <span class="smcap">God</span>; but so much the
more that he is secure of love, will he be busy to love Him and dread
Him, Who has made him so, and done that goodness to Him; and he that is
so high, he will not hold himself worthier than the sinfullest man that
goes on earth. Also seven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span> experiments are there, that a man be in
charity. The first is; when all covetousness of earthly things is
quenched in him. For whereso covetousness is, is no love of Christ.
Then, if he have no covetousness, sign is that he has love. The second
is, burning yearning for heaven. For when men have felt aught of that
savour, the more they love, the more they covet: and he that has not
felt, he desires not. Therefore, when anyone is given so much, till he
love thereof (so) that he can find no joy in his life: token has he that
he is in charity. The third is; if his tongue be changed, that was wont
to speak of earth; now speaks of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and of the life that lasts aye.
The fourth is: exercise of ghostly profit. As if any man or woman give
themselves entirely to <span class="smcap">God's</span> services, and meddle with no earthly
business. The fifth is: when the thing that is hard of itself seems
light for to do; the which love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span> makes. For as Austin says: "Love it is
which brings the far thing near-to-hand, and the impossible to the
openly possible." The sixth is: hardness of thought to suffer all
anguish and hurt that comes&mdash;without this, all the other suffices not.
For whatso befalls him shall not make a righteous man sorry. For he who
is righteous, hates naught but sin; he loves naught but <span class="smcap">God</span>, before <span class="smcap">God</span>:
he dreads naught but to anger <span class="smcap">God</span>. The seventh is: delectability in
soul, when he is in tribulation, and makes praise to <span class="smcap">God</span> in the anger
that he suffers. And this shews well that he loves <span class="smcap">God</span>, when no sorrow
can bring him down. For many love <span class="smcap">God</span> while they are at ease; and in
adversity they grumble, and fall into so great sorriness, that scarcely
may any man comfort them: and so slander they <span class="smcap">God</span>, striving and fighting
against His judgments. And that is caitiff praise that any wealth of the
world makes:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span> but that praise is of great price that no violence of
sorrow can do away.</p>

<p>The fifth asking was: <i>In what state men may most love <span class="smcap">God</span>?</i> I answer,
in such state as it be that men are in most rest of body and soul, and
least occupied with any needs or business of this world. For the thought
of the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, and of the joy that lasts aye, seeks
outward rest, so that it be not hindered by comers and goers, and
occupation of worldly things; and it seeks within great silence from the
annoyances of desires, and of vanities, and of earthly thoughts. And
especially, all who love contemplative life they seek rest in body and
soul. For a great Doctor says: "They are <span class="smcap">God's</span> throne who dwell still in
one place, and are not running about, but in sweetness of Christ's love
are fixed." And I have loved for to sit: for no penance, nor fantasy,
nor that I wished men to talk of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span> me, nor for no such thing: but only
because I knew that I loved <span class="smcap">God</span> more, and longer lasted within the
comfort of love: than going, or standing, or kneeling. For sitting am I
in most rest, and my heart most upward. But therefore, peradventure, it
is not best that another should sit, as I did and will do to my death,
save he were disposed in his soul, as I was.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>Seven gifts of the Holy Ghost are in men and women who are ordained to
the joy of heaven and lead their life in this world righteously. These
they are: <i>Wisdom: Understanding: Counsel: Strength: Knowledge: Pity</i>
and the <i>Fear of <span class="smcap">God</span></i>. Begin we at <i>Counsel</i>, for thereof is most need
at the beginning of our works, which we dislike not afterwards. With
these seven gifts, the Holy Ghost touches separate men separately.
<i>Counsel</i> is doing away with the world's riches, delights, and all
things with which men may be ensnared in thought or deed: and therewith
(i.e. <i>Counsel</i>) be drawn inwardly to contemplation of <span class="smcap">God</span>.
<i>Understanding</i> is, to know what is for to do, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span> what to leave
(undone): and that which shall be given, to give it to them that have
need, not to others that have no need. <i>Wisdom</i> is forgetting of earthly
things, and thinking of heaven, with discretion in all men's deeds. In
this gift, shines contemplation, that is, as S. Austen says "A ghostly
death of fleshly affection through the joy of a raised thought."
<i>Strength</i> is; enduring to fulfil good purpose, that it be not left,
neither for weal nor for woe. <i>Pity is</i>: that a man be mild: and gainsay
no holy Writ when it smites his sins, whether he understand it or not;
but with all his might that he purge the vileness of sin, in himself and
in others. <i>Knowledge</i> is that (which) makes a man in good hope, not
making him quake for his righteousness, but sorrowing for his sin; and
that a man gather earthly good only to the honour of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and to other
men's advantage more than to his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span> The <i>Fear of God</i> is: that we
turn not again to our sin for any egging on: and then is fear perfect in
us and holy, when we dread to anger <span class="smcap">God</span> in the least sin that we can
know, and flee it as poison.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>Two lives there are that Christian men live. One is called Active life,
for it is more in bodily work. Another, contemplative life, for it is in
more ghostly sweetness. Active life is greatly outward, and in more
travail and in more peril, because of the temptations that are in the
world. Contemplative life is largely inward, therefore it is more
enduring and more certain, restfuller, more delectable, lovelier and
more rewarding. For, it has joy in <span class="smcap">God's</span> love, and savour in the life
that lasts aye, in this present time, if it be rightly led. And that
feeling of joy in the love of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> passes all other merits in earth.
For it is so hard to come to, because of the frailty of our flesh, and
the many temptations that we are beset with, which hinder us night and
day: all other things that come are light in regard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span> thereof; for that
may no man deserve, but only it is given of <span class="smcap">God's</span> goodness to them who
verily give themselves to contemplation and to quiet for Christ's love.
To men and women who betake themselves to <i>active life</i>, two things
befall. One: to appoint their household in fear and in the love of <span class="smcap">God</span>,
and to find them in necessaries, and themselves keep <span class="smcap">God's</span> commandments
entirely. Doing to their neighbours as they will that they do to them.
Another is that they do, so far as they can, the seven works of mercy.
The which are: to feed the hungry: to give the thirsty a drink; to
clothe the naked: to harbour them that have no housing: to visit the
sick, to comfort them that are in prison; to bury dead men.</p>

<p>All that can and who have property, they may not be quit with one or two
of these; but it behoves them to do them all, if they will on Dooms-Day
have the benison that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span> <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> shall give to all who do them. Or else they
may dread the malison that all men have who will not do them, when they
had goods to do them with.</p>

<p><i>Contemplative life</i> has two parts: a lower and a higher. The lower part
is meditation of holy writing, that is <span class="smcap">God's</span> word, and in other good
thoughts and sweet that men have of the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>, about the love of
<span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, and also in praising <span class="smcap">God</span> in psalms and hymns and in
prayers. The higher part of contemplation is beholding and yearning
after the things of heaven, and joy in the Holy Ghost: that men have
oft, although it be so that they be not praying with the mouth, but only
thinking of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and of the beauty of angels, and of holy souls. Then
may I say that contemplation is a wonderful joy of <span class="smcap">God's</span> love; the which
joy is praising <span class="smcap">God</span>, that cannot be told; and that wonderful praising is
in the soul:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span> and for abundance of joy and sweetness, it ascends into
the mouth; so that the heart and the tongue agree in one, and body and
soul joy, living in <span class="smcap">God</span>. A man or woman that is appointed to
contemplative life, first <span class="smcap">God</span> inspires them to forsake this world, and
all the vanity and covetousness and vile lust thereof. Afterwards He
leads them by their lone and speaks to their heart, and as the prophet
says "He gives them to suck of the sweetness of the beginning of love":
and then He sets them in the will to give themselves wholly to prayers
and meditations and tears. Afterwards, when they have suffered many
temptations, and when the foul annoyances of thoughts that are idle, and
of vanities which will encumber those who cannot destroy them, are
passing away, He makes them gather up their heart to them and fasten it
only in Him, and opens to the eye of their souls the gates of heaven:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
and then the fire of love verily lies in their heart, and burns therein,
and makes it clean from all earthly filth, and afterwards they are
contemplative men, and ravished in love. For contemplation is a sight;
and they see into Heaven with their ghostly eye. But thou shalt wit that
no man has perfect sight of heaven, whilst they are living bodily here.
But as soon as they die, they are brought before <span class="smcap">God</span>, and see Him face
to face, and eye to eye, and dwell with Him without end. For Him they
sought, and Him they coveted, and Him they loved, with all their might.</p>

<p>Lo, Margaret, I have told thee shortly the Form of Living, and how thou
mayst come to perfection, and to love Him whom thou hast taken thee to.
If it do thee good and profit to thee, thank <span class="smcap">God</span>, and pray for me. The
grace of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ be with thee, and keep thee. Amen.</p>

<h2>Our Daily Work.</h2>

<h3>(A Mirror of Discipline.)</h3>


<p>Three things are needful to every man; to increase his reward, through
<span class="smcap">God's</span> grace helping, Who shall lead him. The first; that man be in
honest work, without losing of his time. The second; that he do his work
with a freedom of spirit, in place and in time, as work falls to each.
The third; that his outward bearing, wheresoever he come, be so honest
and fair, that praise is (given) to <span class="smcap">God</span>, a stirring up of good to all
who see him, as the Apostle bids: <i>Omnia in vobis honesti et secundum
ordinem fiant</i>, that is "That ye do: be it done honestly and in order."</p>

<h2>FIRST PART OF THE BOOK.</h2>


<p>At the first: man shall look that he lose not his short time, nor spend
it wrongly, nor in idleness let it pass away. <span class="smcap">God</span> has lent man his time,
to serve <span class="smcap">God</span> in, and to gather grace with good works, to buy heaven
with. Not only this short time flies from us, but also the time of our
life, as the wise man says: "Our life-time passes away." And S. Gregory
says:&mdash;"Our life is like a man in a ship; sit he, stand he, sleep he,
wake he, ever he gets thitherward where the ship is driving with the
force of the weather. So we, in this short time, whatsoever we do, we
drive ever to our end." And our enemy, Death, follows us ever at our
back, with a sharp spear to stick us through, therefore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span> says Seneca,
"life flies, death follows." And S. Augustine says "Life is nothing else
but a swift running to death." Therefore, there is naught to tell by,
how long man lives: save how well. Yet this short life is uncertain:
wherefore says Job:&mdash;"I know not how long I may endure, and whether
after a short space my Maker may take me away." And S. Gregory says: "I
wot not the time I shall dwell, nor when I shall be taken hence and led
to doom." And S. Jerome says:&mdash;"Nothing so much beguiles man, as that he
knows not the time of his life, that to him is uncertain." And yet hopes
he for long life for himself, as if he might, at his will, drive Death
back. Thus was the rich man deceived of whom speaks the Gospel of S.
Luke xvi. Therefore saith the psalm: "if riches increase, set not your
heart upon them." For riches fail and last not with man, but glide away
like a phantom.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> But when men have got goods together, with right, or
with wrong and poor men's curses, then suddenly, they go from their
goods, or else their goods from them. And Holy Writ says "The world
passeth away and the lust thereof." A man that is fallen in the water,
and through the force of the water is borne forth and torn from the
ground; if he may get anything that has good fastening like a root or a
stake, he may hinder the water from carrying him away; but by anything
that fleets as he does himself, he cannot fasten himself: and soothly,
willy nilly, in this life, as if in water, we are ever passing with the
goods of this world; and there is naught in this world to fasten by, so
that we shall not pass: for the Wise Man saith, "We shall all die, and
like water slip away into the Earth." And therefore Job speaks, as if he
said "Riches and friends had I many, but they all could not hinder me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
from going forth and not coming again." And by what path, man shall go,
the prophet shews: "All flesh is grass, and all the glory of it as the
flower of the field." Man's flesh is as hay, and all his joy and
splendour as the flower of the meadow. Hay is first green grass, and
soon after brings forth flowers: and a while after, the flowers dry and
fall; after it is mown down with the scythe, and dried and taken to a
house to be beasts' food. Thus it befalls man: in his childhood he
springs and grows as the grass does; after, he comes to manhood and
flowers in fairness and strength and wit and having of goods;
afterwards: he draws to age, and then his flowers fall, that are his
virtue, fairness, strength, wit and other power; afterwards, he is
stricken down with the scythe of Death, afterwards taken to a house to
beasts' food, that is, dug into the earth to feed worms. Therefore says
the holy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span> man; "when a man dies, he shall dwell with serpents and
beasts." A dead man is so disgusting to the world, that one cannot let
him be in his house three days together; but bears him forth, that he
harm none with the odour. Therefore, it is now time to work; for in the
time to come there is no time to work, but to receive rewards for deeds
done erewhile. And this the angel affirms with oath and says, "For the
angel has sworn that there will be no further time." Do we then as the
Apostle says: "While we have time, let us work good to all." And as the
Apostle counsels us, he did himself: for from the first hour of the day
until the fifth, he worked with his hands to win his food: and from the
fifth to the tenth, he preached to the people: from the tenth to even he
served the poor and pilgrims with such goods as he had; by night he was
praying, and thus spent he his time.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>In three ways, man loses his time: in idleness; or in works that no good
comes of; or in good works, but not ordained as they should be. Against
idleness, Solomon says&mdash;"Idleness teaches much evil"; and Holy Writ says
"Whoso followeth idleness, is most foolish." A great fool he is who
forbears not from the thing that harms him. More fool he is, because he
wins himself no reward: most fool he is, because he wins himself pain.
Therefore <span class="smcap">God</span> blames the idle: and says "Why standest thou all the day
idle?" Idleness wastes the goods that are prudently gotten, and entices
the fiend to the house: for as by good works the fiend is hindered from
entering man's heart, so idleness draws him thereto. And Seneca says:
"he lives not to himself who lives for his stomach and the ease of his
flesh whenever he can." For Job says "Man is born to labour." To work
was man bound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span> after he had sinned, through <span class="smcap">God's</span> bidding, Who said to
him: "In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread, till thou
returnest unto the ground from whence thou wast taken; because from the
ground thou art, and into the ground thou shalt go." Thou shalt work
stalwartly and not faintly, for He bids thee work, "with sweat of thy
face, even till thou returnest to the earth"; that is, all thy life time
that thou losest no time in idleness. Idleness smites a man as if he
were in a paralysis, and makes his limbs dry that he cannot work.
Therefore says the Psalmist: "They have hands and handle not; feet have
they but they walk not; mouths have they but they speak not; eyes have
they and see not; ears have they and hear not"; for their limbs are so
bound in sin, that to all good things, they are as dead; and to evil,
they are easy. Idleness is nurse to all vices, and makes a man reckless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>about not doing what he is bound to do. And when the fiend finds a man
idle, he puts in his heart foul thoughts of fleshly filth, and other
follies that may bring him to sin; afterwards, he eggs him on to do them
indeed, and thus he does against the Apostle's bidding: "Will not to
give place to the devil." The idle man makes himself unworthy to dwell
in any place but hell. In heaven he cannot dwell; for heaven is full
reward to those who here spend their time in works that they hope are
pleasing to Christ. In purgatory the idle may not dwell; for there only
the good are purged in that cleansing fire, till they be as clean of sin
as when they were christened: therefore saith the Psalm-wright:&mdash;<i>In
labore hominum non sunt et cum hominibus non flagellabuntur</i>: that is
thus for to say; "The idle work not with men; therefore in purgatory
they shall not be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span> pained with those men who are on the way to
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Great shame it is to be idle in this time of grace, in the which we are
hired to work; and if we work as we ought, great reward awaits us. <span class="smcap">God</span>
gives us an example of work, by Himself, as the Apostle says: "He
emptied Himself, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made
in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled
Himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross:
wherefore <span class="smcap">God</span> hath also highly exalted Him, and given Him a name which
is above every name, that at the name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, every knee should bow,
of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;
and that every tongue should confess that <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ is Lord, to the
glory of <span class="smcap">God</span> the Father."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>Over-proud then, and over-delicate is the servant, who rests in battle,
and sees His Lord assailed and evil-wounded by His enemies. Also, we
ought to work in this time of grace; for we are <span class="smcap">God's</span> bought thralls,
with the price of His dear-worthy Blood, to work in His vine-yard: and
yet He doth promise us reward, if we do with good-will that which, as a
debt, we ought to do. To His private friends, before the time of grace,
<span class="smcap">God</span> promised only earthly goods, if they did well; to us the bliss of
Heaven, if we do well. It was long after, before they might come
thereto; for they went to hell and abode there, some a thousand years,
some two, some three, before they came to heaven. But now may men in a
little time win heaven, as, if any die soon after he is christened, or
if he have done full penance for his misdeeds; or be martyred for <span class="smcap">God's</span>
love. The time of supper that the gospel of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span> S. Luke speaks of, to the
which <span class="smcap">God</span> bade His servants call all that were bidden, is the time of
grace; which is now, in the which all is ready; so that there is naught
else to do but wash and go to meat, that is cleanse them of all their
sins that they have done since they were born. What losing of time it is
to travail about things that no profit comes of. Man ought to travail
only to the worship of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and his soul-health. Thou shalt not deem the
man has lived long though he go with a staff stooping, and be
grey-haired; but deem him so old as he has lived well. Therefore
answered Barlaham to Josaphath, his disciple, when he asked him how old
he was: "I am," quoth he, "of 45 years." "Master," quoth Josaphath,
"methinks thou art of 60 years and more." Then said Barlaham, "Since I
was born has been 60 years; but those years that I spent in idleness and
sin before I took me to this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> life, I hold as years of death. But all
those I call years of life that I have served <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ my Lord in,
through His dear-worthy grace." Whoso would bethink himself what time
steals from him in long eating and drinking, in excess and useless
works, idle speech, and idle and foul thoughts, useless jests and other
vanities that men delight them in, he may soothly understand that though
he be old in years, that he has lived little time in the manner that he
ought to have lived; for he lived not to his profit, nor won him reward,
but peradventure pain for losing time.</p>

<p>It were a wonderful thing if the man who gives himself to business of
the world more than he need, had no hindrance in prayer, in rest of
heart, in soothfastness of words, in perfection of good works, in love
to <span class="smcap">God</span> and all Christian men. Therefore, holy men, before now, who knew
their hindrances,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> they fled the world with all its vanities, as if it
had been accursed; for it seemed to them that they could not live a
righteous life therein; and therefore went they into the wilderness,
where they trowed to serve <span class="smcap">God</span> in peace. Therefore says Seneca, "I have
become more avaricious, and more cruel, and more inhuman because I was
among men."</p>

<p>Three manners of occupations there are: as, various and much brawling;
raking about; and much caring about earthly things. Against much
brawling, Solomon says "The beginning of strife is as when one letteth
out water." "Let the water out," that is, "let the tongue fleet out in
quarrelling." But to the knowledge of <span class="smcap">God</span> or of himself may no one come,
who lets his heart fleet out with much useless speech: for he makes a
way in himself for the fiend. Therefore Solomon likens such to a city
without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span> wall: "He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a
city that is broken down and without walls." And because so much
hindrance of good is in much speech, the philosopher binds his disciples
with silence (during) their first five years. Also, Abbot Agathon bore a
stone in his mouth for three years to teach him to hold still. Against
those who are ever raking about to feed their wits with vanities and
lusts is the teaching of the angel, who taught holy Abbot Arsenius and
said:&mdash;"Arsenius, flee the world and its yearnings: keep thee in rest,
bridle thy tongue," that it fleet not out in quarrelling nor idle
speech. Where these three are is a way to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and withdrawing from
evil. It tells of an Abbot who (for) fully 20 years sat in his school,
and never lifted up his head to see the school-roof. Against those who
care over-much about worldly goods, Solomon says this:&mdash;"Vain is their
hope, and their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span> labour without fruit, because they can carry away
nothing of all their labour." This is seen every day, by the dead, who,
be they never so rich bear with them but a winding cloth.</p>

<p>The third manner of men are they that have a liking to do good, but
because they do it not in the manner they should do it in, they lose
their reward; for when good intent fails in any deed, the reward that
should fall to the good work fails. And that may be in four ways; first,
for the wickedness of the working; as the offering of Cain, that though
he offered to <span class="smcap">God</span> of the fruit that was new, <span class="smcap">God</span> would not look thereon:
but to the offering of Abel his brother, <span class="smcap">God</span> looked. Therefore says S.
Gregory: "By the heart's will of him that offers is the gift received of
<span class="smcap">God</span> or rejected: and <span class="smcap">God</span> was not pleased with Abel for the offering, but
pleased with the offering for Abel, who in all his works<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span> was true and
good; but to Cain and to his offering <span class="smcap">God</span> would not look, for he who
made the offering displeased <span class="smcap">God</span> greatly." And why our offering, or what
we do that is in its nature good, displeases <span class="smcap">God</span>, the prophet
says:&mdash;"When ye make many prayers, I will not hear: because your hands
are full of blood." The second that reaves away a man's reward for his
good deed, is vanity, which stirs man to do the good because he would be
praised. For vain-glory makes evil of good: as if alms-deed that is good
in nature be done for praising, it wins only sin. The third that
snatches a reward from a good deed is boasting by him that does the good
deed, as the Pharisee did, of whom <span class="smcap">God</span> said to the folk that stood
before Him, "Soothly, this man has lost his reward for all his good
deed." Needful it is therefore that a man do what good he can, and do
not pride himself thereof in thought or in word;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span> for he has not the
doing of a good deed of himself, nor of his own desiring. The fourth
that snatches from a man his reward for a good deed (is) when he does it
with the intent to be holden better than others, or to lessen the good
deed of others, or to outdo it if he can. Of such, S. Gregory tells a
tale in his dialogues: That once on a time the holy Bishop Fortunatus,
chased the fiend out of a man in one evening; and the fiend, when he was
chased out, put on the likeness of a pilgrim, and went through the city
where the Bishop lived, weeping and yelling like a poor wretch, who was
anxious for lodging that night, and thus he said; "Lo, what your Bishop,
whom ye consider so good, has done to me: he came to the house where I
had taken my lodging, and put me out by force: and now like a poor
wretch, of lodging am I desirous; over all, I seek lodging, and none
will have ruth on me." A man of that city who heard him, took him into
his house,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span> and set him by the fire and eased him, as he wished. When
the man had inquired of him of far-off things, as men do to pilgrims,
the fiend leaped at the child in the cradle, and wrung its neck in two,
and cast it into the fire, and vanished away. Of this S. Gregory speaks
and says, "Many deeds seem good, and are not good, because they are not
done with a good will. And this man harboured the pilgrim for no pity of
him, but because he spake evil of the Bishop, and in order that he" (the
man) "should be held better and of more pity than the Bishop." Yet a
good deed is lost, if a man covet by it to have of man, riches, or
position, or honours or any worldly good. Yet through sin defiling, the
good deed is lost; and here-unto accords Holy Writ that says, "who
sinneth in one thing, loses many good things," which is, "he that in a
deadly thing sins, he loses many goods," save he amend him with shrift,
and do penance therefor.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>
<h2>SECOND PART OF THE BOOK.</h2>


<p>The second part of this book teaches man to do his good work with
freedom of spirit, in place and in time, as falls to each work: not
compelled thereto, nor to do it with anger, nor with a dead heart. For
Holy Writ says: "<span class="smcap">God</span> loves a cheerful giver," or <span class="smcap">God</span> loves him who gives
Him aught with a glad heart: and certainly the works that turn out to
the praise of God, and the health of man's soul, like prayers and holy
thoughts, and a clear mind about <span class="smcap">God</span>, and <span class="smcap">God's</span> deeds; these and others
like them will allow of little rest, if they be well (done). Prayer is a
sacrifice that greatly pleases <span class="smcap">God</span>, if it be made in the manner it ought
to be: therefore <span class="smcap">God</span> asks it of us as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span> a debt, when He says this:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">God</span>
created the peoples for His praise and His glory"; and "the Sacrifice of
praise shall honour Me." And the Apostle, "we ought always to pray and
not to faint." Therefore, it behoves man ever to pray and never to fail.
He is ever praying, who is doing good. And certainly men of religion are
bound to worship <span class="smcap">God</span> with prayer, and men of Holy Church; for they live
by alms and tenths: for all the world labours to bring them what they
need close at hand, so that they may serve <span class="smcap">God</span> in rest, and with their
holy prayers make reconciliation between <span class="smcap">God</span> and man. And also maidens
and widows who have taken the oath of chastity, all these, more than
others, are bound to pray. He that will please <span class="smcap">God</span> with prayer will
offer it to <span class="smcap">God</span> with a free will and loving heart, and will prepare
himself before, as Solomon counsels: "Before prayer, prepare thy soul,
and be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span> not as one that tempteth <span class="smcap">God</span>." He tempts <span class="smcap">God</span> who yearns not to
win that for which he prays: or despairs to speed well therein; and who
makes sin and evil life: such a man thinks not he loves. Of such S.
Gregory speaks:&mdash;"What wonder if tardily our prayers are heard by the
Lord, when we tardily or not at all hear the Lord when He commands?" And
Isidore:&mdash;"He cannot have assured confidence in his prayers who even
thus far in the commands of <span class="smcap">God</span> is slothful, and whom the remembrance of
sinful doing delights." Whoever will speed of his prayer, let him do
what good he can; flee sin, call his heart from the world, and keep it
at home as the Gospel teaches; "When thou prayest, enter into thy
closet, and shut thy door, and pray to thy Father." "Enter," he says,
"thy bed," that is, "call thine heart home," and "then fasten thy door";
i.e., "hold thy wits in thee, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span> none go out." For it is but folly to
pray to <span class="smcap">God</span> to come to us, poor needy wretches, to give us alms of His
dear-worthy grace, and not abide His coming, but turn our back on Him.
S. Isidore says that the soul must be cleansed from the stain of sin,
and the heart be withdrawn from the provocations of the world, in order
that prayer may rise without hindrance to <span class="smcap">God</span>. For far is that man from
<span class="smcap">God</span>, pray he never so much, whose prayers are mixed with worldly
thoughts: therefore says the Psalm "Be still, and see that I am <span class="smcap">God</span>."
This ought to stir us up to pray with great dread and consideration for
we speak with Almighty-<span class="smcap">God</span>, when we are naught but unworthy wretches.
For so did Abraham, <span class="smcap">God's</span> private friend, who said:&mdash;"I speak to my Lord
which am but dust and ashes." And Isidore says:&mdash;"we ought to pray with
sighings and tears, and remembrance of our grimly sins, and of the many
pains and bitter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span> we shall endure for them, unless we amend us, and He
have pity on us." Also, he who prays shall hope to speed well in that
for which he prays; for Christ Himself said, "All things are possible to
the believing": therefore we shall pray to <span class="smcap">God</span> as to our Father in that
for which we pray, if we love Him as our Father, and be His children.
For He says to all His.... He says<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> "Whatsoever ye shall ask the
Father in My Name, He shall give it to you." There are six things to
know in prayer: first, how a man shall prepare himself before. The
second, to whom he shall pray: the third, for whom he shall pray: the
fourth, what he shall ask in prayer: the fifth, what hinders prayer: the
sixth, what might and virtue prayer is of. The first is written already,
and begins at, "Before prayer, prepare thy soul," and lasts as far as
here.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span> The second, to whom shalt thou pray? Soothly, before all others,
to <span class="smcap">God</span> Almighty, as the prophet bids, "Be subject to <span class="smcap">God</span> and pray to
Him." And in the Gospel, <span class="smcap">God</span> says, "Thou shalt adore the Lord thy <span class="smcap">God</span>."
Saints we honour and pray to, not as givers of goodness, but as <span class="smcap">God's</span>
friends to help us to win from Him that we pray after. Therefore, let us
believe in <span class="smcap">God</span> with all our heart, and certain hope, and perfect
charity: our Lord <span class="smcap">God</span> is to be loved. The third, for whom shall men
pray? A great clerk says, "Every Christian man is a living member of
Holy Church, therefore is he bound to pray for all, but specially for
men of Holy Church, as the Pope, Cardinals, Bishops, all who have cure
of men's souls: also for our foes and our friends; and all who are in
deadly sin, that they, through grace, may rise: for all who are in
Purgatory, whom <span class="smcap">God's</span> mercy awaits; and after, all who have occupations,
both<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span> quick and dead. And S. Gregory says that he who prays for all, the
sooner shall be heard and sped of his prayer: and S. Ambrose; "If thou
prayest for all, all will pray for thee." And S. Jerome; "Necessity
binds a man to pray for himself, but charity of brotherhood stirs him to
pray for all: and charity, more than necessity, stirs <span class="smcap">God</span> to hear." The
fourth, what shall men ask in prayer? Certainly, grace in this life, and
endless joy in the other; for so <span class="smcap">God</span> teaches us and says: "Seek first
the kingdom of <span class="smcap">God</span> and His justice, and all these things shall be added
unto you." <span class="smcap">God</span> is debtor to those who are righteous, to find them what
they need of earthly goods: for righteousness makes men <span class="smcap">God's</span> children,
and a father by his nature is bound to find for his children. Earthly
goods are not to be asked in prayer, for they have done harm to many,
therefore Solomon says "How long, ye fools, will ye<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span> desire those things
which are hurtful to you?" Therefore, every man should ask of <span class="smcap">God</span> with
fear, that he ask and pray his Lord that if He see that his prayer be
necessary and reasonable, that He will fulfil it: and if it be not
necessary and reasonable, that He will withdraw it; for what may help
and what may harm, the Leech knows better than the sick man. But one of
these two shall we trust to have through prayer; either, that we pray
for, or that which is better for us. The fifth, what hinders our prayer
from being heard by God? Six things: the first is the sin of him who
prays; as <span class="smcap">God</span> says through the prophet, "when ye make many prayers, I
will not hear; because your hands are full of blood." And David: "If I
have looked upon iniquity with my heart, the Lord will not hear." And
the prophet; "Our sins have hid His face from us." And the Gospel:
"Because we know <span class="smcap">God</span> does not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span> hear Sinners." The second is the
unworthiness of that for which men pray, and that <span class="smcap">God</span>, through the
prophet, forbids them to pray for: "Pray not for this people, neither
lift up (praise) nor prayer for them; for I will not hear." It tells in
the life of the holy Fathers that one who was bound in sin came to the
holy Abbot, S. Anthony, and said, "holy Father, have mercy on me and
pray for me:" to whom the holy Abbot said; "I will have no mercy on
thee, unless thou helpest thyself and leavest thy sin." The third is
foul and idle thoughts, that hinder us from thinking on our prayers. Of
such false prayers, God says through His prophet: "This people honour <span class="smcap">Me</span>
with their lips, but their heart is far from <span class="smcap">Me</span>." It is great wickedness
of us unworthy wretches that when we speak with prayer to Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span>,
we also unwittingly hearken not to what we say. Soothly, great
displeasure we do to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span> <span class="smcap">God</span> when we pray Him to hear our prayer, and we
will not hear it ourselves: but it is worse to waste our time in foul
and idle thoughts. Abraham, when he made a sacrifice to <span class="smcap">God</span>, fowls of
the air lighted thereon, and would have defiled it; and he cleared those
birds away, so that none durst come nigh it, till all the time were
passed, and the sacrifice made. Let us do so with these flying thoughts,
which defile the sacrifice of our prayer. This sacrifice is agreeable to
<span class="smcap">God</span>, when it comes from a clean and loving heart. <span class="smcap">God</span> bids: "send prayer
to <span class="smcap">Me</span>, and I shall send grace to thee; and whatso thou dost for <span class="smcap">Me</span>, I
forget it not." The fourth, that hinders our prayer from being heard, is
hardness of heart; and that is in two manners; first hardness of heart
against the poor; and thereof the prophet says "who shuts his ear to the
cry of the poor, he may call and I will not hear him." The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span> other is the
hardness of those who will not forgive to those who have misdone them:
to such, Solomon says:&mdash;"Forgive thy neighbour who has injured thee
while he prays to thee, and thy sins shall be forgiven." And the Gospel
says: "As thou standest praying, forgive if thou hast aught against any,
and your Father which is in heaven will forgive your sins." The fifth,
that hinders our prayer from being heard, is little yearning after the
things that men pray for: and S. Augustine says: "<span class="smcap">God</span> stores this up for
thee, that with thy whole heart it may be desired; "for He will not to
give to Thee hastily, that so thou mayst learn great things greatly to
desire." And S. Gregory says: "if with our mouth we pray after the bliss
of heaven, and do not yearn for it in our heart, we are crying still."
The sixth, that hinders our prayer; is foul and idle speech, that we
fill our lips with; for if thou givest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span> a great lord drink in a slutty
cup, were the drink never so good, he would feel disgust therewith, and
bid throw it away, were his thirst never so sore: so <span class="smcap">God</span> does with a
prayer that comes from a foul mouth; He esteems it not, but turns
therefrom. Therefore says S. Gregory: "The more our lips are defiled
with foolish talking, so much the less are they heard by <span class="smcap">God</span> in prayer."
The sixth, what might and virtue prayer is of. Men who were before this
age, who kept themselves in soothfastness, and spoke nothing idle, won
from <span class="smcap">God</span> what they prayed for: and that was shewn to a holy hermit
Florentius, who dwelt in a wilderness unknown of men. So much vermin was
there about this hermitage, that none durst come thither by a long way.
A deacon was in that land, who heard of this hermit, and he came at the
last to the place where this hermit was dwelling; but he saw so much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
vermin about that he durst not come near: but cried out for help in
fear. The holy man came out to know who it was that cried; and he saw a
man standing there, and inquired what he would have. And the deacon
said; "holy Father, I have sought thee from far, and now I have found
thee, I should have joy enough if I might come to thee, but I cannot for
these venomous beasts that are here so many." When the holy man heard
this, he fell down on his knees, and prayed <span class="smcap">God</span> that He would destroy
those worms: and all soon a grisly storm arose with a thunder, and slew
all the worms. Then said the hermit to our Lord; "Lord, these beasts lie
here so thickly, that I cannot come to him nor he to me, save we be
poisoned by them. Lo, Lord, they lie here dead, but who shall lift them
away?" At his word, many birds came, and carried them all clean away.
Hereof speaks S. Gregory:&mdash;"Because <span class="smcap">God's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></span> servants withdraw themselves
from the world and its works, uselessly they cannot speak: so they bind
them to silence that they dare say no word save it be teaching others or
praising <span class="smcap">God</span>: and therefore, when they ask <span class="smcap">God</span> aught, He grants it at
once." But we, woful wretches, who deal with the world, that chatter all
the day like magpies; now lie, now twist, now speak evil, now quarrel,
now backbite, now swear great oaths, these defile our prayer and hinder
it, that it is not heard; for our mouth is as far from praying <span class="smcap">God</span>, as
it is near the world with idle speech. Prayer is so mightful if it have
its right, that it masters the fiend, and hinders him from doing his
will. For so it did the fiend whom Julian the Emperor commanded to go to
the other side of the world to bring him tidings how it was there. When
he had flown ten days' journey thitherward, he came over the place that
Publius the hermit dwelled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span> in, who was praying at that time. And his
prayer overtook the fiend, and held him there fast fully ten days&mdash;for
all that time, the hermit was in prayer: and when he ceased, the fiend
turned back, for he could no further go, since prayer hindered him.</p>

<p>When thou hast gathered home thine heart and its wits, and hast
destroyed the things that might hinder thee from praying, and won to
that devotion which <span class="smcap">God</span> sends to thee through His dear-worthy grace,
quickly rise from thy bed at the bell-ringing: and if no bell be there,
let the cock be thy bell: if there be neither cock nor bell, let <span class="smcap">God's</span>
love wake thee, for that most pleases <span class="smcap">God</span>. And zeal, rooted in love,
wakens before both cock and bell, and has washed her face with sweet
love-tears; and her soul within has joy in <span class="smcap">God</span> with devotion, and
liking, and bidding Him good-morning, and with other heavenly gladness
which <span class="smcap">God</span> sends to His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span> lovers. Blessed are they above others whom <span class="smcap">God</span>
wakens, for they have many joys while others sleep, for they find that
gladness before them, rise they never so soon; for <span class="smcap">God</span> Himself thus
says: "he that early wakens to <span class="smcap">Me</span>, he shall find <span class="smcap">Me</span> to speak with him,
and shall rejoice himself in <span class="smcap">Me</span>, and have <span class="smcap">Me</span> at his will." Be then a
waker, and rise quickly, and thank heartily thy Lord <span class="smcap">God</span>, for the rest
thou hast had, and for the care of angels. Since a knight has great
liking to be called to come and speak with the king, when he knows it is
for his great profit: with greater reason, ought <span class="smcap">God's</span> knight, that is
every Christian man, to be ready at the calling of his Lord, Who calls
him for his great profit, and for nothing else. Soberly, rise thou with
a good cheer, and think that thou hearest <span class="smcap">God</span> call thee with these
words: "Arise My love, My fair one, and come and shew Me thy face: I
yearn that the voice of thy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span> prayer may ring in Mine ears." Think in thy
rising, how that night many men perished in life, and some in soul, and
some in body and soul: some burned, some drowned, some suddenly dead
without repentance or shrift, and their souls drawn by fiends to hell;
some fallen into deadly sin, as lust, gluttony, theft, envy,
manslaughter, and other several sins. And from all these perils, thy
good <span class="smcap">God</span> hath delivered thee, of His goodness not of thy desert. What
hast thou done to <span class="smcap">God</span> that He should care for thee so, and suffer so
many others to be lost? and peradventure thou hast done worse than they
have done. If thou lookest well at what <span class="smcap">God</span> has done for thee though
thou hast not served Him, thou mayst find that <span class="smcap">God</span> is as busy to do thee
profit as if He had naught else to do, and as if He had forgotten this
whole world, and thought only on thee. When thou hast this thought,
lift<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span> up thine heart to <span class="smcap">God</span> and say:&mdash;"I thank Thee, dear-worthy Lord,
with all my heart, Who hast thus cared this night for me, a so unworthy
wretch, and hast suffered me that with life and health I thus abide this
day. I thank Thee, Lord, for this great good, and many others that Thou
hast done to me, a so unkind and unworthy wretch, more than all others:
that Thou shewest me such kindness against my evil deeds." And put
thyself and all thy friends in <span class="smcap">God's</span> hands, and say thus: "Into Thy
dear-worthy hands, my Lord, I yield my soul and body, and all my
friends, kindred and stranger: and all who have done me good bodily or
ghostly, and all who have received Christianity: that Thou, for the love
of Thy Mother, that dear-worthy Maiden, and the beseeching of Thy Saints
defend us this day or this night from all perils of body and soul, and
from all deadly sins, from temptation <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>of the devil, and sudden death,
and from the pains of hell, and make us dread them. Do Thou hallow our
hearts with grace of Thy Holy Ghost, and make us, whatsoever we do here,
do Thy will, that we never separate from Thee, dear Lord. Amen." When
thou hast done, go to the Church or Oratory: and if thou canst win to
none, make thy chamber thy Church. In the church is most devotion to
pray, for then is <span class="smcap">God</span> on the altar to hear those that to Him pray, and
grant them what they ask or what is better: and in presence of Saints,
and in worship of churches that are hallowed, protection of angels who
are there to serve their Lord and thee&mdash;for their office is to receive
thy prayer, and bear it to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and bring thee grace from Him, as S.
Bernard says: "Rise then quickly, at <span class="smcap">God's</span> call, and put all heaviness
from thee, and answer thy Lord with the words which Samuel said to <span class="smcap">God<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></span>
Who called him in the night: 'Speak Lord, for Thy servant heareth.'"</p>

<p>For eight things we ought to wake and ever be doing good: this short
life: the strait way we have to go: our good deeds that are so few: our
sins that are so many: death that we are sure of and wot not when: the
strait and so hard doom of Doom's-day, for every idle thought shall be
shewed there, then shall every foul word and sinful work be greatly
pressed, for <span class="smcap">God</span> says "For every careless word," etc.: and S. Anselm,
"what wilt thou do in that day when all the time expended is required of
thee; how it has been laid out by thee, even to the minutest thought."
The seventh thing is the strong pain of hell: the eighth, is the joy of
heaven. After thine uprising, pray for the souls that are in pain of
Purgatory, and think that thou hearest them cry on thee the words of
Job: "Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span> friends, for the hand of
<span class="smcap">God</span> is laid upon me," and help them with <i>De Profundis</i>, and <i>Absolve</i>.
After, greet our Lady, with <i>Salve Regina</i>, on thy knees. Go then to the
Church, and bid thy vain thoughts and business of the world keep outside
thereof: and at thine incoming, say to thy soul, "Enter thou into the
joy of thy Lord, and thou shalt hear His Voice, and behold His temple."
Holy Church is the entrance and gate of Heaven. After, fall down before
the Cross, and honour Him because He was slain on the Cross, and say "We
adore Thee, O Christ, and bless Thee, because by Thy holy Cross Thou
didst redeem the world." And then before thou uprisest, have in thy mind
how hotly His love burned, That died for thee on the Cross. After, begin
thy matins, but first cross thy lips and say "O Lord, open my lips":
i.e., "Lord, open my lips that all night have been shut from praising<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
Thee, and I cannot open them, except Thou help me." And then say, <span class="smcap">Deus</span>
<i>in adjutorium</i>, with these words, pour out thine heart before <span class="smcap">God</span> and
say; "Lord, as my Doom's-Man, before Thee I stand: do Thou avenge me of
my foes, which hinder me from serving Thee, and they assail me keenly so
that I be soon overcome unless Thou dost help me." And at <i>Gloria
Patri</i>, bow down and say with thine heart, "Lord, of Thy blessing, I
beseech Thee." Turn thee to the angels who stand about to thy comfort
and help, and as thy wardens to keep thee from thy foes, and thus say to
them <i>Venite exultemus, Domino</i>. Afterwards, cast thine eye on somewhat,
and keep it there while thou makest thy prayers, for this helps much to
the stabling of thine heart; and paint there, thy Lord, as He was on the
cross; think on His feet and hands that were nailed to the tree; and on
the wide wound in His side,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span> through the which way is made to thee, to
win His heart; thank thy Lord thereof, and love Him therefor: for these,
they who thither may win, find treasure of love. Think thou seest His
wounds streaming of blood, and falling down on the earth; and fall thou
down and lick up that blood sweetly, with tears kissing the earth, with
remembrance for that rich treasure, which for thy sins was shed, and say
thus with thine heart:&mdash;"Why lieth this blood here as if lost, and I
perish for thirst? Why drink I not of this rich payment that my Lord
gives me to drink and cool my tongue, and hear what <span class="smcap">God</span> says to me: <i>He
who is thirsty, let him come and drink. Thou shalt taste and see how
pleasant the Lord is; how sweet, how mild, how merciful.</i> With such
meditations, angels come to thy soul, and <span class="smcap">God</span> is there, and says to His
lover:&mdash;"What wouldest thou that I should do for thee?" and thou dost
answer;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span> "Lord it is enough for me, a sinful wretch and outcast of Thy
people, to praise Thee and love Thee, if I could, for so I well ought."
If thou canst win to such thinkings in thy prayers, thou shalt have such
joys that it shall be a pain to thee to think of aught else. S. Bernard,
for the liking that he had for such stirrings desired that matins-time
might last till Dooms-day. Think, when thou standest or kneelest in
prayer, that thou seest <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ come with angels and holy Saints on
each side, and angels carrying before Him basketsfull of help which is
left from the feasts of Saints who dwell with <span class="smcap">God</span> in heaven: that <span class="smcap">God</span>
bade them gather up to help the poor with, that naught might be lost.
This help is meat to us poor wretches, who would perish in default of
it, unless <span class="smcap">God</span> had pity on us. Think thou hearest <span class="smcap">God</span> cry: "Whoso has
need of meat, put forth thine hand, and have." And bow thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span> with thine
head to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and lament thy poverty to Him and say "There is no bread in
mine house"; and also say, "Lord, so long meatless have I been, that I
die of hunger save Thou takest pity on me; and naught can hold my life
in me, save meat that Thou givest." Stir thyself up with such
recollections, and by others that may kindle thy devotion and raise it
to Him, even until thou thinkest thou hearest Him say to thee, "Open thy
mouth wide, and I will fill it." And then, through <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace, shalt
thou feel something of that heavenly food that feeds all Hallows, that
thou mayest with liking sing the Maiden's Song, that is <span class="smcap">God's</span> Mother's,
<i>Magnificat anima mea dominum et exultavit spiritus meus in <span class="smcap">Deo</span> salutari
meo</i>. When <span class="smcap">God</span>, through His grace, sends thee such likings, turn thou
kindly to the angels who stand before thee, and to them say: "I pray you
as my keepers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span> whom <span class="smcap">God</span> has sent to me, that ye thank your good Lord for
me." And turn thou then to the altar, where <span class="smcap">God</span> truly is, and say,
"Truly, O <span class="smcap">God</span>, great is Thy mercy towards me," that is, "Soothly Lord,
great is Thy mercy that Thou shewest to me." With such love-stirrings,
<span class="smcap">God</span> comes to His lovers: and waits not till the prayer be made, but
presses in to the midst, and softens the languishing soul, with a
bedewing of heavenly sweetness: and tears and sighings are messengers of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> coming. Blessed are they who thus mourn and languish to <span class="smcap">God</span>, for
they shall never separate from <span class="smcap">God</span>, but have Him ever at their will.</p>

<p><i>How <span class="smcap">God</span> comes to His lovers; and how sometimes He departs from them.</i>
<span class="smcap">God</span>, when He comes to His lovers gives them to taste how sweet He is;
and before they can fully feel, He goes from them, and, as an Eagle,
spreads His wings, and rises above them, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span> if He said: "Some part
mayst thou feel how sweet I am: but if ye will feel this sweetness to
the full, fly up after Me, and lift your hearts up to Me, where I am
sitting on My Father's right hand, and there ye shall be fulfilled in
joy of Me." <span class="smcap">God</span> comes to His lovers to comfort them; he departs from
them so that they should humble themselves, and that they should not
over-much pride themselves for the joy that they have of His coming: for
if thy spouse were aye with thee, thou wouldest esteem thyself over well
and despise others: and if He were aye with thee thou wouldest impute it
to nature and not to Grace. Therefore, through His grace, He comes when
He will, and to whom He will, and departs when He will: so that His long
dwelling makes one not more unworthy; but that after His departing, He
be more yearned for and sought with zealous love and sighings and tears.
But beware thou, <span class="smcap">God's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></span> lover, though thy Spouse withdraw Himself from
thee for a while, He sees all thy deeds, and thou canst hide nothing
from Him: and if He wit thou lovest any but Him, unless it be for love
of Him, or if thou makest any love-semblance to other than Him, so soon
He departs from thee. Jealous is thy Spouse, delicate, noble and rich;
seven times brighter than the sun; in fairness and might all others He
surpasses, and what so He wills is done in heaven and earth and hell. If
He sees any stain of filth in one who should be His dear, He turns from
him soon, for uncleanness can He see none. Therefore, be thou chaste,
shame-full, and mild of heart, and with love-longing yearn for Him above
all things. And when <span class="smcap">God</span> withdraws this heavenly likeness and sweetness
from thee, as sometimes need be in this deadly life, give not thyself to
fleshly lusts and likings of the world; but to prayer and meditation,
reading <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>of Holy Writ, or honest work. And ever mourn thou after thy
love, as a young child who misses his Mother. For he that, after such
knowing of <span class="smcap">God</span> and tasting of His sweetness, turns him back and gives
him to sin, he has no defence for his sin against <span class="smcap">God</span>. An unhappy chance
it is and full of care to love the fellowship of <span class="smcap">God</span> and of His angels
and Saints and to serve the fiend and follow his counsel with lusts and
likings and works of sin: that heart which was hallowed through the Holy
Ghost to be <span class="smcap">God's</span> temple, that was raised here above his nature to have
heavenly likings and joy with <span class="smcap">God</span>, all soon makes itself loathly and
foul with foul thoughts: those ears that heard the words that it is
allowable to speak to none, open themselves to hear back-bitings and
lyings and other idle speech; those eyes that just now were baptized
with tears, open themselves to see vanities: that tongue that just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span> now
spake to <span class="smcap">God</span> in prayer, all soon with that dirty tongue, forswears,
backbites, and speaks foul words. Pray we to <span class="smcap">God</span> that of His goodness He
keep us from these vices. Of <span class="smcap">God's</span> coming men may know by this that S.
Bernard says: "When thou art stirred of man in outer or inner spirit to
care for righteousness and stand up for it, to be meek and patient, to
love thy brothers in <span class="smcap">God</span>, to be buxom to thy superiors, to love chastity
and cleanness in body and soul, token is it that Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span> comes to
visit thy soul." If thou takest godly chastening from thy friend for thy
sin, or words that stir thee to virtues and good ways, this makes way
for and token of <span class="smcap">God's</span> coming. Then if thou puttest from thee slowness
and heaviness, and with a love-yearning likest such words; then
dear-worthy <span class="smcap">God</span> thy Lord hastes Him to thee, for the desire that <span class="smcap">God</span> has
to thee; kindles thy desires to have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> likings for such words, and makes
thee bitterly repent thy sin and amend thy life. For, at His incoming,
He wakens the soul, stirs it and softens it, and washes its wounds with
wine, and softens them with oil; that is, stirs it to repent bitterly
what it has misdone, and softens it with hope of mercy and forgiveness
of sins. He rives sin up by the roots, as a gardener does evil weeds,
and grafts good trees, and sows good seed, where the weeds grew. So does
<span class="smcap">God</span>, who is called a gardener while He is in man's soul: He rives up
sins by the roots, and grafts in that soul virtues and good ways: what
was dry He bedews it with grace: what was black and mirk, He makes it
white: what was bound, He looses: what was cold, He makes warm with
love. By these stirrings, mayst thou know thy Lord is come; by stirring
of thy heart, destroying of vices, withdrawing from lusts, amending of
life, repenting misdeeds, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>beginning of a new man in <span class="smcap">God</span>, every day more
and more. And by this mayst thou wit, when He goes from thee; the
gladness wanes, slow thou waxest dry and heavy, as a stone; love cools
in thee like a pot that had been welded, and the fire was withdrawn
therefrom. But then needs the soul to mourn sorely until He come again.
If foul thoughts egg thee on to leave the Lord thy <span class="smcap">God</span>, say this "Whose
is this image and superscription?" if he says "Caesar's," that is the
prince of this world, that is the fiend of hell, say to him, "Go again
thou foul fiend with thy false money: bear it again with thee to hell;
for my gates are shut, and my Lord dwells herein, therefore have I no
time to deal with thee." Think on that holy greeting that Gabriel made
to that maiden, Mary in Nazareth, how joyful she was in body and soul in
that time; through that quieting, with her assent, she was fulfilled of
grace, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span> that she won might and power, in heaven, and earth, and hell;
and on her hangs all the world's health and restoring of those that
fell. Think on the birth of her Child, how she bare Him without sorrow
and grief that all other women have naturally in time of birth; and she
clean maiden after. Think when He was born, they laid Him in a crib
before an ox and an ass, other cradle had He none. There was none to
serve Him with the light of torches as men do before great lords:
therefore there came a fire from heaven that lighted the house He was
in, and Bethlehem; and angels came from heaven to sing the child asleep
with a merry voice. Think how Three Kings came from far lands through
knowing of a star, and offered Him gold, incense and myrrh: think how
sweetly the child smiled on them, and with His lovely eyes sweetly
looked on them. Think how poorly His Mother was clad when the Kings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
kneeled before her: for on her she had but a white smock as the clerks
say, more to cover herself with than for shewing of pride. Think how His
Mother came with Him to the Temple to make her offering of cleansing,
and bowed to fulfil the Law as if they were sinful. Think how the old
priest Symeon took the Child in his arms, and blessed <span class="smcap">God</span>: for there,
through the stirring of the Holy Ghost, he saw the Saviour of all this
world between His hands, and prayed that he might pass out of this
world, "for mine eyes have seen Him Who saves the folk." Think of that
sorrow His Mother had when she missed Him and sought Him three days, and
then found Him among the Masters, hearing and inquiring of points of the
Law. Think how He came to be christened of S. John: how the Holy Ghost
lighted then on Him in the likeness of a Dove, the Father there with
voice recorded that He was His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span> Son. Think how He hallowed wedlock in
the house of the Ruler of the Feast, and there, to show that He was
Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span> changed water into wine. In the wilderness, how he fasted
40 days without meat; how He overcame the fiend that tempted Him with
three: with gluttony, and covetousness, and vain-glory, and of the
wonder men had of His preaching, for all the words He spake to them were
full of grace. How He healed the sick, raised the dead, gave sight to
the blind, speech to the dumb, health to the leper, with touching of His
hands: and many other sicknesses that were in their nature incurable, He
healed through the might of His words, for He could do more than Nature.
How He was weary of much going; rested Him at the well; and then He bade
give Him water to drink for He thirsted sore. Then, open thine heart
with sore sighings, and think on the passion and pains that <span class="smcap">Jesus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></span>
Christ suffered, as they are written before on the xviii leaf.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>He may ask grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and certainly trust to speed, who here stirs
himself up with good works, and with devotion and likings: flavours them
so that they may be savoury to his dear Lord. Works of penance, as
fasting, waking, hard fighting, forbearing of fleshly lusts, prayers,
alms-deed, and other things that we do with devotion and likings in <span class="smcap">God</span>,
it behoves that so they be done with a glad heart, and with a freedom of
spirit. Devotion is a worthy affection that <span class="smcap">God</span> sends to the heart to
gladden it with: but unworthy is he to have this gift, that will make no
dwelling-place in his heart for it. We seek with our belief what is
above us, but it savours us not, for we are so full of earth that we
have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span> lost our taste. Why do so many men feel the stirrings that the
fiend forges, and suffer his enemy so often to overthrow him? I see
nothing that does this, save lack of grace. Among all other (things) I
trow we grieve <span class="smcap">God</span> most, because we will not labour to win this grace of
<span class="smcap">God</span>: and <span class="smcap">God</span> promises His grace to all that will to receive, if that
their vessel be clean and empty to receive it in. But S. Bernard says:
"The heart that is loaded with covetousness of the world, it can have
neither devotion nor liking in <span class="smcap">God</span>; for soothfastness and vanity, a
lasting and a failing thing, a ghostly thing and a bodily cannot be
brought together at any time." So worthy a thing is the comfort of <span class="smcap">God</span>
that it will not rest in a breast where other comfort is. So delicious
is the liking in Him, that with no other liking can it accord. Whoso
yearns after other comfort to glad himself with, witnesses against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
himself that he withstands <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace: unless it be honest comfort
betimes that he may thereby glad his nature with, and better serve <span class="smcap">God</span>.
After thou hast spent thy time in prayers, and holy thoughts and good
works, in <span class="smcap">God's</span> holy dread, prepare thyself for food to strengthen thy
nature which would else fail. And to this intent shall every Christian
man clothe and feed his body; that it may the better serve his Lord, in
whatsoever he does. In the morning, thou shalt go to thy meat, with
soberness and measure; care for thy self in thy meat-time; and after
meat, make thou praising to thy Lord that He has fed thee, and also
before meat, and for all the good deeds that He has done to thee. First,
or ever thou goest to meat, thou shalt mourn as holy Job did, who thus
says, "Before I eat I sigh," because my nature is made weak and feeble
for Adam's sin; and every day needs bodily meat to uphold the nature
that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span> else would fail in a little time. And, as it tells in the life of
the holy Fathers; Isidore that holy man, when he ate, he wept sore and
said, "I am ashamed of myself for I live by beastly meat as other beasts
do that have no reason by nature; and I, <span class="smcap">God's</span> reasonable creature, made
like to Himself, that should have dwelt in Paradise, and there have been
fed with heavenly food." When thou findest delight or savour in meat and
drink, think on the heavenly Saints whom all likings pass by, and we be
never satisfied till we feel thereof. Men of religion hear lessons of
holy men's lives at their meat, so that as the body is fed with bodily
food, so the soul be fed with holy words. Man's body is as a burning
furnace, and specially in the young; and delicious and hot meats and
drinks make that fire to burn hotter: therefore says S. John:&mdash;"Plenty
in time of youth is double fire." Therefore all that kindles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span> sin in the
flesh is to be fled from. The wise man says, "If thou wilt abate the
flame, abate the brands." And S. John; "Flesh-meat and wine are kindling
of fleshly stirrings." And S. Austin; "the flesh is as a wild colt,
which is to be tamed with bridle and hunger." And Solomon; "Rod and
burden fall to the ass," that betokens our flesh. Wisely should a man
consider the meat that comes before him, and take of them in such
measure that they grieve him not, but that through them, he may serve
<span class="smcap">God</span> better. Therefore S. John bids:&mdash;"Ever when thou eatest, ever hunger
thou, that after meat thou mayst read and pray and serve <span class="smcap">God</span> better."</p>

<p>Holy men who have been before us enjoyed strong sharp meat, more to
abate hunger than for pleasure. Some lived by grass, some by roots, some
by spices and herbs and fruit that the earth bore; and in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span> whatso they
ate they destroyed all taste that might stir them to pleasure. Also, S.
Germanus mixed ashes with his bread, that he should feel no pleasure in
his meat-time. Other sauce than hunger, they took none. S. Gregory says:
"bread made of bran and water, with cold or other simple pottage is good
food to the well-taught stomach, with sauce of <span class="smcap">God's</span> love if he have it
therewith: without this sauce, no sustenance has savour that man
enjoys." Some eat no meat before the night; some only every other day;
some fast three days together. Machari fasted all the Lenten-tide, save
Sundays, and ate naught but raw leaves. Some take no heed when they eat,
nor what they eat, flesh or fish: all tasted alike to them, so that
afterwards, they wist not what they ate. Some, when they were set down
to meat, and meat was brought before them, they forgot to eat, for so
they spent the day and the night in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span> holy speech, that they thought of
naught else, till the undern-tide<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> of the second day, so that the
brethren came to them and asked why they could not eat: and then, for
the first time, thought they of meat, and they ate then as they thought
good, in <span class="smcap">God's</span> holy fear. When thou art set to thy meat, make before
thee a cross on the board with five crumbs to stir thee up to think on
Him who died for thee on the Cross; and think, here lies His head that
was crowned with thorns, there His hands, there His feet that were
nailed full fast; there was His sweet side that was opened with the
spear, from which came both blood and water to heal my dirty wounds.
When thou hast so done if thou canst, take part of thy bread and of thy
fish, and lay it by itself, and say thus quietly in thine heart, "Lord,
what wilt Thou give me for this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span> pittance I make to Thee? how many
tears, how many love-yearnings and longings after Thee? how many
comforts of the Holy Ghost, how many stirrings to good things, how many
lookings towards me with Thy lovely eyes? Lord, wilt Thou for this meat
that the poor hungry man shall have for Thy sake, give me the love of
Thee?" When thou hast eaten what thou thinkest good, thank thy Lord that
He hath fed thee. After meat, be thou worthy, and keep thee from much
speech and idle games, and hold thy wits inward in fear of <span class="smcap">God</span>. Seemly
it is to man, and pleasing to <span class="smcap">God</span>, that his bearing be more honourable
and temperate after meat than before: that no taking of excess be seen
in him, that the flesh may serve the soul better in reading, praying and
other ghostly works, that may help to good things. Then Even-song say,
with the devotion that <span class="smcap">God</span> sends thee, in Church or Oratory, or
wheresoever <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>thou mayst say it best, away from the noise and throng of
the world. After, if thou needest, go sup: and short be thy supper time:
so in measure take thou meat and drink that it be no burden nor
grievance to thy nature, nor hindrance to serve thy Lord; or in time of
rest reave from thee thy sleep; or the fiend defile thee with foul
temptations in thy sleep, as he often does him who goes to bed with a
full stomach. Every man eat, as S. John says, "according as he is strong
or old, or according as his body is greater or less, or whole or sick;
take what is needful for sustenance of nature, and not as pleasure
asks." After supper, go to the Church or other place, where thou mayst
be most at rest, and say thy Compline, for in this time as S. Ambrose
saith, "birds in their language praise their Lord, and thank Him after
their kind, for the goods He has sent them." Call thou then on thy <span class="smcap">God</span>
and say <i>Converte nos</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span> <i><span class="smcap">Deus</span> salutaris noster</i>, as if he said, "Lord, I
have been this day hindered by the world, that has greatly hindered me
from serving Thee; through temptation of the fiend and of my flesh oft
this day have I done amiss; therefore, my Lord, turn me now from the
world, and from all that may hinder me from praising Thee with a pure
heart and with all my wits, so that they be intent on Thee to work Thy
will," And then, say forth thy Compline, and after, other prayers with
the devotion that <span class="smcap">God</span> sends thee. And after, before thou goest to bed,
hold a chapter with thine heart, and ask it in what things it is better
than it was. Hast thou shriven thee of that sin that thou didst then and
there? of the words that thou spakest there? of that evil will that was
in thee then? of that wrong that thou didst and saidst there to him? of
that handling? of that blame? of that foul thought? of that thing left
undone <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>that thou should'st have done? art thou willing to leave off
such vices? What temptations withstood'st thou this day? in what art
thou meeker than thou wast? in what more chaste, more sober, more
patient, more temperate, more loving thy <span class="smcap">God</span> in thy brother, or more
liking in <span class="smcap">God</span> hast thou than thou hadst? Hast left that sin that thou,
through habit, fallest into so oft? and other many vices that thou hast
done and pleased the fiend with: and grieved thy good <span class="smcap">God</span>, and hast
barred thyself against the grace that should help thee. And then, with a
repenting of those sins that bite thy conscience, knock on thy breast
and say a <i>Pater noster</i> with <i>Ave Maria</i>, on thy knees, and soon in the
morning shrive thee of those sins. And if thou doest thus, I hope the
fiend shall be afeared to tempt thee, for thou art under <span class="smcap">God's</span> ward,
whilst thou bearest thee thus. After this reckoning, where-through thy
soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span> is raised to a blessed hope to the Father of mercy, and thy flesh
waxes heavy, go to thy rest: for if thou hinderest thy flesh of its
necessity, and work it beyond its might, faintly will it help thee, or
hinder thee withal. And or ever thou goest to rest commit thyself and
thy friends into <span class="smcap">God's</span> hands, who for us was nailed to the tree, and
beseech Him, for His mercy, that He guard thee from all perils of body
and soul, and arm thee with the token of the cross; for where the fiend
sees this mark soon he flies. Of this mark, it is written in the life of
S. Edmund: that as he went one time alone, a child appeared to him who
was wonderfully fair, and said, "Hail, my friend, whom I love in <span class="smcap">God</span>."
S. Edmund was surprised at this greeting, and the child said to him,
"knowest thou me not?" And S. Edmund said to the child, "How should I
know thee? I never saw thee before." And the child said to him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span> "When
thou didst learn in school, I sat ever by thy side; and ever since I
have been with thee, wheresoever thou hast dwelt; for so my Lord has
fastened me to thee, that I might never part from thee, such is my
Lord's will. But behold on my forehead, and read what thou seest there."
He looked as he told him, and with heavenly letters, these four words,
he saw there written, <i><span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Nazarenus Rex iudeorum</i>. Then said the
child, "This is my Lord's name, thou seest thus written. This name I
will that thou have in mind, and print it in thy soul, and cross thy
front with this name; before thou goest to sleep; and from harassings of
the fiend, it shall protect thee that night, and from sudden death, and
all who thus by night cross themselves therewith." And when he had
spoken these words, he vanished away. Carry some holy thoughts to bed
with thee, and say thy prayers, till sleep fall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span> on thee. To have soft
sleep and sweet, a sovereign help is measure and soberness in meat and
drink: with recollection of <span class="smcap">God's</span> law and Holy Writ; as <span class="smcap">God</span> says through
the prophet, "Keep My law and My counsel, and if thou sleepest thou
shalt not be afraid; if thou dost rest thy sleep shall be sweet." And
ever, as thou wakenest, lift thine heart to <span class="smcap">God</span>, with some holy thought,
and rise and pray to thy Lord that He grant release from pains to the
dead, and grace to the living, and life without end. If temptation of
lust stir thee in bed, think that thy good Lord hung on the Rood for
thee; think on His five wounds that streamed down of blood: think that
His bed was the hard knotty tree, and instead of a pillow He had a crown
of thorns. And say then, with sore sighing, till thy desire cool, "My
dear-worthy Lord hanged on the Rood for me; and I lie in this soft bed,
and welter me in sin, like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span> foul swine that loves but filth." Rise
then quickly, and hold thee with prayers, love-sighings and tears. Of
three points beware. The first, that the devotions thou hast through
grace stirring, be not known of others: hide them, so far as thou mayest
with will and deed for fear of vain glory. The second, that thou
thinkest not it is in thy power to have such devotions and stirrings
when thou wilt: but only through <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace when He will send them. The
third, that thou thinkest not over-well of thyself for such stirrings;
nor thinkest thou art therefore dear to <span class="smcap">God</span>; nor deem another more
unworthy who does not as thou dost; but when thou hast done all well,
think soothly by thyself, and grant it in words; "It is nothing worth I
do, Lord: for I am but a useless thrall." If thou wilt lose no reward,
deem none other, but hold thyself most unworthy; for if thou fastest or
prayest more than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span> another, perchance another surpasses thee in
meekness, and patience and loving. Therefore think of what thou lackest,
and not only of what thou hast. Nevertheless, <span class="smcap">God</span> wills that thou
should'st think on those graces and goods He has done for thee, to stir
thee up to know thyself indebted to Him for them, and serve Him and love
Him the more; or if thou beest in grief to glad thee with. Sometimes, it
falls out that in <span class="smcap">God's</span> doom, one is better whom men deem evil than some
that men deem good. Many are worthy without and unclean within. Some
worldly and dissolute, and <span class="smcap">God's</span> private friends within. And some, in
man's sight bear themselves like angels; and in <span class="smcap">God's</span> sight, they stink
as sinful wretches. And some seem sinful to men's doom, and are full
dear to <span class="smcap">God</span> Almighty, for their inward bearing is heavenly in <span class="smcap">God's</span>
bright sight. Therefore, judge we none other save ourselves. And pray we
for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> ourselves and all others to <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ, Mary's Son, Who for us
was nailed on the Rood, that whoso is bound in deadly sin, He loose
them; and they who are in good life, that He grant them end therein.</p>

<p>Two messengers are come to thee to bring thee tidings. The one is called
Fear, who comes from hell to warn thee of thy danger: the other is
called Hope that comes from Heaven to tell thee of bliss thou shalt have
if thou doest well. Fear says he saw so many betortured in hell, that if
all the wits of men were in one, he could not tell them: of gluttons,
unchaste, robbers, thieves, rich men with their servants who harmed the
poor: judges who would not give judgment except for reward: treasurers
who by subtilty maintained injustice: deemsters who condemned loyal men
and delivered stark thieves; workmen who worked dishonestly and took
full hire; tillers of the soil who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span> tilled badly; prelates, with the
care of men's souls, who neither punished nor taught them; of all sorts
of men who have wrongly wrought; then I saw that every one bought it
bitterly. For there I saw want of all good, and plenty of pain and
sorrow; as hot fire burning ever, brimstone stinking: grisly devils like
dragons gaping ever; hunger and thirst for ever lasting, adders and
toads gnawing on the sinful. Such sorrow and yelling and gnashing of
teeth, I heard there, that nearly, for fear, I lost my wits. Such
mirkness there was, that I could grip it; and so bitter was the smoke
that it made the woe-ful wretches shed glowing tears; and bitterly I
heard them ban the day when they were born. Now, they long to die, and
cannot. Death, which, sometime they hated, were liefer to them now than
all the good of this world. And therefore I warn thee that thou amend
thee of thy sins with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> shrift and penance, and have a steadfast will to
leave them for ever: a seat I saw made for thee in hell of burning fire,
where devils should pain thee ever unendingly.</p>

<p>That other messenger, who is called Hope says he is come from Heaven to
tell thee of that untellable great joy that rules <span class="smcap">God's</span> friends; "to
tell thereof as it is may no earthly man speak though his tongue were of
steel. For there is a gracious fellowship of all <span class="smcap">God's</span> friends, orders
of angels, and of holy saints, and Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span> above, Who gladdens them
all. Of all goodness, I saw plenty; beauty and riches that last for
ever; honour and power that never shall fail; wisdom and love and
everlasting joy. Then I heard melody and song of bright angels. So
worthy is that joy and so great withal, that whoso might taste of it a
blessed drop, he should be so ravished in liking of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and such
yearning he should have to win thither,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span> that all joys of the world were
pain to him. With so great a love he should be overtaken in yearning to
win to that bliss, that by a hundred times it should more stir him to
love virtue and flee sin than any fear he might have of the pain of
hell. And I tell thee for sooth, if thou wilt leave sin, and do <span class="smcap">God's</span>
bidding, and love Him as thou oughtest, a rich and a fair seat <span class="smcap">God</span> has
made for thee wherein thou shalt dwell with Him unendingly.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>
<h2>THIRD PART OF THE BOOK.</h2>


<p>The third and the last part of this book teaches a man to bear himself,
wheresoever he comes, and whatsoever he does: that it be to the praise
of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and an example of good to all who see him: for thus the Apostle
counsels: "Let everything be done honestly and in order"; that is "all
that ye do, look ye do it honestly and orderly." Then at the first, let
every lover of <span class="smcap">God</span> see that ye yearn not to mingle with the world, that
hinders and deceives all who deal with it, and hinders them from the
many good deeds they might do. And the man who will nowhere rest but aye
rake about; their eyes see many things, that the eye sends to the heart,
and such come not out easily when they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span> are once imprinted. S. Bernard
complains of the harms that he felt in the world whilst he was therein,
and says "the world surrounded me and weighed me down": that is "The
world has besieged me on every side; and through the gates of my five
wits it shot at me and wounded me full sore; and through the wounds,
death presses in, to slay my sorry soul. Mine eyes look, and my thought
changes and kindles me in sin. Mine ears hear and my heart bows me
thereto. I smell with my nose, and it pleases my thoughts. With my mouth
I speak, and in my speech I please or beguile others: and with a little
over-soft feeling, lust kindles in my flesh; and the fiend, my foe, whom
I cannot see, stands ever against me with his bow bent." Therefore, if
necessity make man to go into this world, where are so many stirrings to
sin, with great fear shall he go, as into a battle to fight his foes. It
needs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span> he be well armed against the arrows of his foe, that severely
shoots at him; and the more may he dread him because he cannot see him:
with foot-traps and snares is the way set full. Therefore, let him who
shall go forth, arm him with <span class="smcap">God's</span> holy fear. <span class="smcap">God</span> warned His disciples
to be wary in the world when He said thus: "Soothly the world shall
withstand you with temptations." Therefore, if thou must go out, for
thine own profit or that of others, colour not thy going with any false
hue, to feign for thyself an occasion to dally with the world, for
pleasure or command, or to be known with praise before others....</p>

<p>And therefore they make a show with words and feign as they can, to be
holden holy of all who see them, that give themselves to dalliance with
the world, more than needs, as to buying, selling or quarrelling about
earthly things. And all their outward bearing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>so accords with the world
that David says: "They have mixed themselves with the peoples; they
partake of their works": that is, they mingle them with the folk of the
world, who have no knowledge of <span class="smcap">God</span>, and such works as they see them do,
such works they do. Therefore, when thou needest to go forth, cross
thyself with the holy name of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span>, Mary's Son, who died on the Rood
for thee, for then thou art more secure, whithersoever thou goest, as S.
Austin said to his brother, when they went forth. And S. John says:
"Whitherso thou goest, and whatsoever thou doest, thy forehead and thy
breast mark thou with the cross; for there is no other mark the fiend so
greatly dreads." See that thine outer-clothing be not over-loathsome,
nor over-curious, in shape nor in hue. Keep thy limbs to their business,
to which they were made, and do not cast thine eyes about like a child;
flourish not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span> thine hands, and leap not with thy feet. When the heart of
man is out of ward, the limbs sometimes fail in their office. And, as
thou orderest thine outward bearing when thou goest forth, also look
thou that thou beest devout within, and specially in praying to and
praising the Lord. If in going out, thou canst not rest in saying thy
prayers, go the softlier. Many things hinder thee in toiling to pray;
weariness of limbs; men thou meetest who speak to thee; then thy five
wits fleet out of ward, and then the devotion of him who prays, cools.
When walking thou hast said thy prayers that thou art bound to say, lift
up thy heart to <span class="smcap">God</span>, and pray to Him in thy thoughts in a blessed
recollection: think on the good things <span class="smcap">God</span> has done for thee, and shall
do if thou truly servest Him: think on His biddings and do them indeed
according to thy might, for so <span class="smcap">God</span> bids thee when He thus says:&mdash;"The
words which I command thee shall be in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span> thine heart, and thou shalt
relate them to thy sons: and thou shall meditate on them, sitting in
thine house, and walking on thy journey, sleeping and arising." Or in
working, tell fair tales to thy fellows, or something from Holy Writ
that may soften your way, or glad you in <span class="smcap">God</span>. And sometimes say the
Seven Psalms for the quick and the dead, that <span class="smcap">God</span> give grace to the
quick and rest to the dead. When thou comest to the town to ease thy
body, seek where thou mayst most worthily dwell for thy condition and in
most peace: and where thou mayst most profit to thyself and others. Let
flesh-lust and vanity entice thee to no place: but inquire where any is
who most loves <span class="smcap">God</span>, and thither draw thou. Seek not where thou mayst be
fed best, for there peradventure are many stirrings to sin. Harbour thee
with no woman unless thou knowest good of them for a long time. When
thou art come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span> to the house thou shalt rest in, hold thy wits inward in
<span class="smcap">God's</span> holy fear; so that thine outer bearing be so ruled with grace that
thou mayst stir to good all whom thou seest, and through <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace
destroy mirkness of sin, and so fulfil <span class="smcap">God's</span> teaching, who says thus,
"So let your light shine before men, that they seeing your good works
may glorify your Father Who is in heaven." And S. Gregory says: "Neither
is it greatly praiseworthy to be good with the good, but to be good with
the evil; for even as it is of more heinous guilt not to be good among
the good, so is it of unwearied honour to have stood for the good among
the evil."</p>

<p>Keep well thine eyes when thou art come to harbour, from all things that
may kindle sin and make thine eyes forward, as Job did, who said "I make
a covenant with mine eyes lest I should think upon a maid." After sight,
comes thought, and thereafter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span> deed, and therefore said the prophet
Jeremiah, "Mine eye hath laid waste my soul." When so holy a prophet
lamented him of his eyesight, sorely may another complain who oft sins
therewith. Augustine: "Shameless eye is the messenger of shameless
heart." Gregory: "It is not lawful to look after that which it is not
lawful to desire." David: "Turn away mine eyes that they may not see
vanity." Look also that thou hearest nothing that may stir thee to sin,
as unclean words, backbiting, false judgments, great oaths, controversy,
striving and other such vices. Also at thy meat, bear thyself orderly,
and hold thee in measure, and seek after no dainties, but be pleased
with common meats. Consider in speaking, to whom, what, when, how, of
whom, and where: and have thyself so orderly that thou beest not like
other worldly men, but fulfil the Apostle's words; "Be not conformed to
this world, because your conversation is in heaven."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Though our body be in this world as a clot of earth, it is needful that
our spirit which was bought with the dear-worthy blood of <span class="smcap">God</span> Almighty
be with mind and will in heaven, not soil itself here with sin, as swine
do in a ditch. And whatsoever thou doest, and wheresoever thou comest,
do as the Apostle teaches: "Shew thyself to all men as an example of
good works," for through a good example <span class="smcap">God</span> is worshipped and praised,
men are helped and taught and strengthened in their belief. Bear thee so
that men who dwell with you may say of you as was said of the Apostles
Paul and Barnabas, "The gods are made like men, and have come down to
us." <i><span class="smcap">Deo</span> gracias.</i></p>

<h1>On Grace.</h1>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>
<h2>On Grace.</h2>


<p>Three degrees of grace there are. The first <span class="smcap">God</span> gives to all creatures,
to uphold them with; and this is called <span class="smcap">God's</span> help freely given to all
creatures; and without this gift of grace, creatures cannot do, nor last
in their kind; for as water is made hot through fire and becomes cold
again if the fire be withdrawn, so, as S. Austin says, "All creatures
that are made of naught, so are they worth naught in a little time,
unless <span class="smcap">God</span> upholds them with His grace." Therefore says the Apostle
"Through the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span>, I am what I am." As if he said, "That I live,
that I feel, that I speak or hear or see, and all that I am: all this I
have only through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace." The second degree of grace is more
special: that <span class="smcap">God</span> gives freely to every man who is a good and reasonable
creature: and this grace stands ever at the gates of our hearts, and
knocks on our free-will, and bids it let it in. This, <span class="smcap">God</span> says that He
does: "Behold, I stand at the door knocking," that is, "I stand at the
door of thine heart and knock; let Me in." And this grace is given
freely to man before he deserves it. Then let every man make himself
worthy and ready to receive His gift of the Holy Ghost, Who ever stirs
man's free-will to good, and calls it from evil. Two things are needful
to the health of man's soul. The first is this grace that I speak of:
the second, is man's free-will according thereto. And without these two,
no man can do thoroughly what he ought, that should help him to health
of his soul; for neither free-will, without this grace stirring,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> nor
this grace without free-will assenting, can do aught that pleases <span class="smcap">God</span>.
Therefore, says S. Austin, "He Who made thee without thee, will not
justify thee without thee"; that is, "He Who made thee without thee,
will not make thee righteous, save thou helpest thereunto." And though
the free-will of man cannot make the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> in man, nevertheless,
let man do what is in him, and prepare himself, that he may be ready and
able to receive the grace, when it comes. If thou wert in a mirk house
one day, and doors and windows shut: if thou wouldest not let the sun
come in, who was to blame if the house were mirk. Also blame none save
thyself, if thy grace be less. For S. Anselm says, "Man lacks not this
grace, for <span class="smcap">God</span> gives it to him; but he has it not, because he does not
make himself ready to receive this grace as he should." <span class="smcap">God</span> is not
stingy of His grace, for He has enough thereof;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span> for though He deal it
out never so far, and to so many, He never has the less; for He only
wants clean vessels, to put His grace in. Therefore says S. Austin; "<span class="smcap">God</span>
by vast freedom and abundance fills all creatures according to their
capacity": that is, "<span class="smcap">God</span> through His great freedom of His great grace
fulfils all creatures according as they are able to receive His grace."
If man opened his heart to this grace when <span class="smcap">God</span> sends it to him, he would
shew it in works; for the Apostle, when he had won it, said, "His grace
in me was not in vain," that is "the grace that <span class="smcap">God</span> has given me, is not
useless in me"; for he enjoyed it ever in work. We unite with <span class="smcap">God</span> in His
grace, as merchants do together: for <span class="smcap">God</span> sets His grace against our
work; but for His grace and His death, He wills (to have) naught but our
praising and thanking, and He wills that man should have all the profit
that may arise thereof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span> But they try to reave from <span class="smcap">God</span>, His part, who
would be praised of men for good deeds. Against them, <span class="smcap">God</span> says, "I will
not give My glory to another"; that is, "Praising and worship that
belong to Me, I will give to no other." Thou shalt understand, that
free-will of man is to turn freely to good or ill. Three states there
are of man; before sin, after man's sin, and after man is confirmed,
that is, after man is departed out of this deadly life, and come to that
joy that shall never end. In the first place, before man sinned, was
man's will so free, that he could sin or not sin: in his free-will it
was, to do good or ill. In the last state, that is confirmed, shall man
sin no more. In the second state, in which he may sin, and may not but
sin, man's will is free to ill, till it be strengthened with grace: and
when grace leads the will, then it is free to work the good. Before man
sinned, no hindering had he from doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span> good, nor no need to do ill: but
now has sin joined with our flesh, and bred what S. Paul calls the "law
of the flesh," so that it is master of the flesh, and withstands <span class="smcap">God's</span>
law in all that it can. This hinders our will from assenting to good;
and stirs it to ill so that it may not work good, unless grace helps and
accustoms him away from sin. Every man before he sins, has a free will
to do good or ill, but when he is bound to the fiend, through works of
sin, he may through no power of himself come out of his bonds: and then
he fares like a ship that in a tempest has lost all that could help it,
and is cast from wave to wave whither the tempest drives it. Right so, a
man who lacks <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace, because he be fallen into deadly sin, he does
not what he would, but aye wavers from hand to hand, at the fiend's
will, and unless <span class="smcap">God</span> give him grace to rise out of his sin, he shall be
in sin to his life's end, and after, be lost body and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span> soul, and damned
to endless pain. If the folk or the common people choose them a king,
and he be confirmed in his kingdom, he be never so ill to them, they can
do naught to him, unless it be through some other, who has more power
than he: and so, it behoves them suffer, do he them never so much ill.
Right so, man before he sins, has a free will to choose whether he will
be under <span class="smcap">God</span> or the fiend; and when, with his will, he chooses to serve
the fiend, he cannot after, when he would, come out of his bonds. And
therefore, worldly men who are bound in sin say to them who counsel them
to amend their lives, "fain would we rise, but we cannot." No, they
cannot through might of themselves, but through <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace helping them
they can. The third grace is most special; for it is given only to those
who receive the second grace; and with their free-will fulfil it in
deed, and can say as S. Paul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> said, "The grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> was not in vain in
me." And S. Austin says; "<span class="smcap">God</span>, working with us, fulfils that which He,
through grace stirring, began in us." For neither without His helping
can we do good to ourselves, nor please Him: as <span class="smcap">God</span> says Himself
"without Me, thou canst no nothing." <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace stirring, goes before
good will, and stirs it to do the good and leave the ill.</p>

<p>Grace, when it comes first to visit man's soul, wakens him as out of a
slumbering and inquires of him with those sharp words: "Where art thou?
Whence comest thou? Whither shalt thou?" First he says, "Where art
thou?" as if he said, "Bethink thee, unhappy wretch, how foul thou art
cast down, and what peril thou art in. For, for thy sin thou art fallen
into the enemy's hands, who above all things dost covet to work thy woe;
and naught may deliver thee out of the foe's hands, but Almighty <span class="smcap">God</span>,
thy good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span> Lord, Whom thou hast forsaken." After he says: "Whence comest
thou?" as if he said, "thou wretch, behold how thou hast wasted thy life
in sin; thou comest from the fiend's tavern&mdash;Where are all the goods
that <span class="smcap">God</span> has given thee to help thee with, and to worship Him? Sorrily
hast thou lost them. Thy Lord made thee rich, and thou art become a poor
wretch." After, he inquires, "Whither wendest thou?" "Woeful wretch thou
wendest to the woeful doom, that <span class="smcap">God</span> dooms men to; for as thou hast
served so shalt thou be judged. So awful shalt thou see <span class="smcap">God</span> there, that
thou shalt for fear be out of thy wits; and to the mountains and hills
thou shalt cry with a grisly noise, and pray them to fall on thee and
hide thee, that thou see Him not. Woeful wretch, thou wendest to hell,
if thou dost forth as thou hast begun, where thou shalt find fire so hot
and so raging, that all the water in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span> sea, though it ran through it,
should not slake a spark thereof. And because thou stinkest here to <span class="smcap">God</span>,
for thy foul sin, there thou shalt feel everlasting stink: and because
thou lovedst mirkness here, for aye to be in sin, there shalt thou feel
such thick mirkness that thou canst grip it; and because here thou didst
rest thyself in sin against <span class="smcap">God's</span> will, there shalt thou shed more tears
than there are motes in a sunbeam. Thou shalt suffer pain ever after
pain, ever to renew thy woe."</p>

<p>When <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace has stirred man and wakened him with these three, and
has made him to know the peril he is in, then he conceives a terror of
<span class="smcap">God's</span> awful doom: and therethrough, he begins to repent whatever he did
ill, and covets to amend himself through <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace, that stirs him to
flee ill and give himself to good: and then comes grace following, to
help the goodwill of man to fulfil <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>it in deed. For though man have a
good will to do the good, through grace before stirring the good will,
yet can he not do indeed without <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace following and helping: and
this the Apostle affirms of himself when he says; "But not I, but the
grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> in me"; that is, "the good which I do is naught, but <span class="smcap">God's</span>
grace does it with me"; as if he had said, "I can do no good, unless
<span class="smcap">God's</span> grace help me." <span class="smcap">God's</span> will is also a handmaiden to grace, to work
all her will. <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace, wherever it be, will not be useless, but ever
working and growing more and more, to increase thy reward. Therefore do
we as the Apostle counsels us, "We exhort you, brethren, that ye receive
not the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> in vain"; that is, "I pray you and bid you, my
brothers in <span class="smcap">God</span>, that ye receive not <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace in vain." He receives
<span class="smcap">God's</span> grace in vain, that enjoys it not in good, when <span class="smcap">God</span> sends it to
him;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> and therefore perhaps, he shall never after win thereto. Isidore
tells of a little fly that is called <i>Saura</i>, and this fly betokens
grace stirring beforehand. This kind of fly is said to be the enemy of
all venomous worms, so that when he sees any worm (going) toward man to
sting him when he sleeps in the wilderness; he flies before to the man,
and lights upon his face, and bites him a little; and therethrough he
wakes before the beast comes to sting him. By this <i>Saura</i> is understood
grace that <span class="smcap">God</span> sends to man against the temptations of the fiend, who
often stings venomously: it cries unto thee, as the Apostle says;
"Awake, thou that sleepest, and rise from the dead, and Christ shall
give thee light." But the unthankful act against this grace, and ruin
it: as Virgil did with this little fly that saved him from death. He lay
asleep, and an adder came toward him: but this fly Saura flew before,
and lighted on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span> his forehead, and pricked him a little, and therewith he
wakened; also the adder came; but this Virgil, in his waking, felt his
forehead smart, and smote himself on the face; and so he slew the fly,
and so repaid him for his service, who saved his life. Therefore do thou
not ruin <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace when it comes to thee, to warn thee of harm and
stir thee to good. Glad ought man to be of <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace, when <span class="smcap">God</span> sends
it to him, and to take care full warily of so rich a gift: for grace is
earnest-money of that lasting joy which is to come, as the Apostle says:
"the grace of <span class="smcap">God</span> is eternal life"; that is, "<span class="smcap">God's</span> grace is like a help
and way to everlasting life." Therefore, He sets grace before us as the
way that leads to everlasting joy: and also a pledge, if we keep it
well, to make in us certainty of endless joy; as the Apostle says, "Who
gave us His Spirit as a pledge in our bodies," that is "<span class="smcap">God</span> has given us
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span> Holy Ghost as pledge of endless joy." Hold we then this heavenly
pledge; and enjoy we it well in work; for it is well for us in this
life, if <span class="smcap">God's</span> grace lead us; and when grace leaves us, we fail of that
welfare. Therefore, through help of grace let us destroy in ourselves
everything that is against grace, be it less or more, that our reason
says is against <span class="smcap">God's</span> will, that is, all that is sin, or may stir to
sin: and let us have repentance in our heart, shrift in mouth, and
withstanding, with will never to turn again.</p>

<h1>An Epistle on Charity.</h1>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>
<h2>On Charity.</h2>

<p class='center'><i>By what tokens thou shalt know if thou lovest thine enemy:
and what example thou shalt take from Christ to love him</i>.</p>


<p>And if thou beest not stirred against the person by anger or fell
outward cheer, and have no privy hate in thine heart for to despise him,
or judge him, or for to set him at naught: and the more shame and
villany he does to thee in word or in deed, the more pity and compassion
thou hast of him as thou wouldest have of a man who was out of his mind,
and thou thinkest thou canst not find in thine heart to hate him, for
love<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span> is so good in itself, but prayest for him, and helpest him, and
desirest his amending, not only with thy mouth as hypocrites do, but
with thy affection of love in thine heart, then hast thou perfect
charity to thy fellow-Christian. This charity had S. Stephen, perfectly,
when he prayed for them who stoned him to death. This charity, Christ
counselled to all who would be His perfect followers, when He said thus:
"Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, pray for those who
persecute and calumniate you." And therefore, if thou wilt follow
Christ, be like Him in power. Learn to love thine enemies, and sinful
men, for all those are thy fellow-Christians. Look and bethink thee how
Christ loved Judas, who was both His bodily enemy and a sinful caitiff:
how goodly Christ was to him; how benign; how courteous; how humble to
him whom He knew to be damnable; and nevertheless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span> He chose him for His
Apostle, and sent him to preach with the other Apostles; He gave him
power to work miracles: He shewed to him the same good cheer in word and
deed; also with His precious Body; and preached to him as He did to the
other Apostles: He condemned him not openly, nor abused, nor despised
him, nor ever spake evil of him: and yet even though He had done all
that, He would but have said the truth! And above all, when Judas took
Him, He kissed him and called him His friend. All this charity, Christ
shewed to Judas whom He knew to be damnable. In no manner of feigning or
flattering, but in soothfastness of good love and clean charity. For
though it were truth that Judas was unworthy to have any gift of <span class="smcap">God</span>, or
any sign of love, because of his wickedness; nevertheless, it was worthy
and reasonable that our Lord should appear as He is.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>He is love and goodness, and therefore it belongs to Him to shew love
and goodness to all His creatures, as He did to Judas. Follow after,
somewhat if thou canst; for though thou beest shut in a house with thy
body, nevertheless in thine heart, where the place of love is, thou
shalt be able to have part of such a love to thy fellow Christians as I
speak of. Whoso deems himself to be a perfect follower of <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> Christ's
teaching and living, as some men deem that they be, inasmuch as one
teaches and preaches, and is poor in worldly goods as Christ was, and
cannot follow Christ in His love and charity, to love his
fellow-Christians, every man, good and ill, friends and foes, without
feigning, flattering, despising in heart, angriness and melancholious
reproving, soothly, he beguiles himself: the dearer he deems himself to
be, the further he is. For Christ said to those who would be His
followers, thus:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span> "This is My commandment, that ye love mutually as I
have loved you."</p>

<p>"This is My bidding, that ye love together as I love you, for if ye love
as I loved, then are ye My disciples." He that is meek soothfastly, or
would be meek, can love his fellow-Christians: and none save he.</p>

<h2>Contrition.</h2>


<p>Richard Hermit rehearses a ... tale of perfect contrition that the same
clerk Cesarius tells. He tells that a scholar at Paris had done full
many sins of which he was ashamed to shrive him. At the last, great
sorrow of heart overcame his shame, and when he was ready to shrive him
to the Prior of the Abbey of S. Victor, so great contrition was in his
heart, sighing in his breast, sobbing in his throat that he could not
bring one word forth. Then the Prior said to him, "Go and write thy
sins." He did so and came again to the Prior, and gave him what he had
written, for still he could not shrive himself with his mouth. The Prior
saw the sins were so great, that with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span> scholar's leave, he shewed
them to the Abbot to have his counsel. The Abbot took the writing
wherein they were written, and looked thereon. He found nothing written,
and said to the Prior, "What can here be read where naught is written?"
Then saw the Prior and wondered greatly, and said "Wit ye that his sins
were here written, and I read them: but now I see that <span class="smcap">God</span> has seen his
contrition and has forgiven him all his sins." This the Abbot and the
Prior told the scholar, and he, with great Joy, thanked <span class="smcap">God</span>.</p>
